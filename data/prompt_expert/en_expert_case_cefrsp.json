Here is an example of how the sentence could be rewritten to make it easier to understand : Calcium nitrate is added to waste water before it is treated to stop it smelling badly. This version of the sentence uses simpler vocabulary ( ' added ', ' stop it smelling badly ' ) and a more straightforward structure. It also removes the technical terms ( ' pre - conditioning ', ' odor emission prevention ' ) and uses more general language ( ' waste water treatment ' ). This makes the sentence more accessible to non - specialists. Note that the main idea of the sentence is still preserved, but it is now expressed in a way that is easier to understand.
