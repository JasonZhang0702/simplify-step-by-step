Shall we include diagrams in our sociology presentation ?,4,"Should we use pictures in our presentation?

Here is the complex sentence to be rewritten:

The new employees will have to attend an induction course on Monday morning before their first day of work . 

Simplified version for A1 CEFR level language learners:
New employees come on Monday. They learn something first. Then they start working.

or 
New employees must go to school on Monday. They learn about the job before they start working.

The first simplified sentence uses shorter sentences and basic vocabulary, while the second one uses a more natural sentence structure and adds a bit more detail to help learners understand the context. 

In rewriting the sentence, I replaced ""induction course"" with ""school"" to make it more relatable to A1 learners, and changed ""attend"" to ""go to"" and ""learn something"" to make the language more straightforward. I also used a more conversational tone to make the text more engaging and easier to understand. Finally, I kept the main idea of the original sentence intact, which is that new employees need to learn something before starting work.

The high cost of housing in many parts of the world is one of the most important factors contributing to poverty in low-income households because it forces families to spend a large part of their income on rent or mortgage payments, leaving them little money for other essential expenses such as food, clothing, and healthcare, which in turn makes them vulnerable to hunger, poor health, and other forms of deprivation.

And here is the rewritten sentence at the A2 level:
Housing is expensive in many countries. This makes life hard for poor families. They have to pay a lot for their homes. This leaves them with little money for food, clothes, and doctors. So, they might go hungry or get sick.

Note: I used a simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""expensive"" instead of ""high cost"", ""hard"" instead of ""important factors contributing to"", ""pay a lot"" instead of ""spend a large part of their income on"", etc.) and a more straightforward sentence structure to make it easier to understand for A2 level language learners. I also deleted some unimportant information (e.g. ""parts of the world"", ""low-income households"")","Students who celebrated Japan's win stayed up late but cleaned up afterwards. ( Example 5 )

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: B1 level learners can read simple factual texts on their favourite topics with a good understanding. 

This revised sentence is more accessible to B1 CEFR level language learners as it uses simpler vocabulary (""simple"", ""favourite"") and shorter sentences.

This revised sentence breaks down the original text into three shorter sentences, each with simpler vocabulary and grammar. It also omits the subordinate clause (""As I walked through the city streets"") to make the text more manageable for A1 level learners. The main idea of the original sentence – that old buildings are being demolished and new ones are being constructed – remains intact,","People said she was the Czar's daughter, but she wasn't.

Do you think that Carl will be the valedictorian of the class of 2017 ?,5,"Do you think Carl will be the best student in his year?

Original sentence: A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the pharaoh.
Simplified sentence: It shows the name of the king.

Explanation: 
The original sentence is complex because it contains several unfamiliar vocabulary items (serekh, royal crest, pharaoh) and a formal tone. To simplify it, we replace the complex vocabulary with simpler synonyms (e.g., ""king"" instead of ""pharaoh""). We also remove the phrase ""normally used as a royal crest"" to make the sentence more concise. The resulting sentence, ""It shows the name of the king,"" is still grammatically correct and retains the main idea of the original sentence. A1 CEFR level language learners can understand this sentence because it uses basic vocabulary and a simple structure. 

Note: The CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is a framework used to describe language ability. A1 is the lowest level, indicating that learners can understand very short, simple texts and basic phrases. They can pick up familiar names, words, and basic phrases, and reread as required. This level is suitable for beginners who have just started learning a language.

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts and understand them well enough.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I simplified the sentence:

1.  I replaced ""straightforward factual texts"" with ""simple factual texts"" to use a simpler synonym.
2.  I changed ""related to their field of interest"" to ""on subjects they're interested in"" to make it more natural and easy to understand.
3.  I kept ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" as it's a clear and important idea, but I could have rephrased it to ""and understand them well enough"" to make it even simpler.
4.  I kept the sentence structure simple and straightforward to",2,3,2

Original sentence:
The parents of a child who has been missing for several weeks have finally found their son after a massive search operation involving over 100 police officers and several helicopters .

Simplified sentence:
A boy has been missing for many weeks. His parents are happy because they found him.

Explanation:
1) The original sentence is a complex sentence because it contains several clauses (i.e., independent and dependent clauses) connected by various conjunctions. For example, ""who has been missing for several weeks"" is a dependent clause that describes the child, while ""have finally found their son"" is an independent clause expressing the main action. 
2) To simplify the sentence, we need to identify the main idea, which is that the parents found their missing son. We can then eliminate unnecessary information such as the number of police officers and helicopters involved in the search operation.
3) We can also replace complex vocabulary like ""massive search operation"" with simpler synonyms like ""search"".
4) Finally, we can split the sentence into two simpler sentences: one stating that the boy has been missing for","They are active all day and rest on the mountainsides.

Original Sentence:
The development of biotechnology has led to the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that have been engineered to produce high yields of useful products such as medicines , vaccines , and biofuels , and have also increased crop resilience to environmental stresses such as droughts and extreme temperatures , which has resulted in improved food security and reduced the risk of famine in developing countries .

Simplified Sentence:
Biotechnology has helped create new kinds of plants that can make medicines , vaccines , and fuel . They can also grow well even when there is little water or very hot weather . This means that people in poor countries are less likely to go hungry .

Note: In this example, I have replaced ""genetically modified organisms"" with ""new kinds of plants"", ""engineered to produce high yields of useful products"" with ""make medicines , vaccines , and fuel "", and ""increased crop resilience"" with ""can grow well even when there is little water or very hot weather "". I have also split the original sentence into two simpler sentences, one describing the benefits of GMOs and the other explaining how these benefits affect people in developing countries. This makes the text easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners","Every day , bharal eat and rest on the mountain grass.

This revised sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original but is written at a lower level of complexity. Here's a breakdown of the changes made:

* ""Straightforward"" is replaced with ""easily"", which is a more accessible synonym.
* ""Factual texts"" is replaced with ""texts"", which is a simpler phrase that still conveys the idea of non-fiction writing.
* ""Subjects related to your field of interest"" is replaced with ""things you're interested in"", which is a more conversational and relatable phrase.
* ""Satisfactory level of comprehension"" is replaced with ""understand them well enough"", which is a more natural way to express the idea of being able to comprehend something. The word ""satisfactory"" is also removed, as it may not be familiar to all learners. This revised sentence is more suitable for B1",3,3,3

Here is the complex sentence that you need to simplify for A1 CEFR level language learners:
Complex:Many people think that a perfect life is one where you have lots of money , good health , a happy family , and a nice home , but this is not true because many people who have these things are still unhappy .They may be lonely or feel stressed and anxious all the time .
Simple:Some people think that having money, being healthy, and having a happy family and home makes you happy. But this is not always true. Even when people have these things, they can still be unhappy. They might be lonely or worried.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the complex sentence
The complex sentence contains several key elements: the definition of a ""perfect life,"" the factors that contribute to happiness, and the counterargument that having these factors does not guarantee happiness.

## Step 2: Simplify the complex sentence by using simpler synonyms
Replace complex words with simpler synonyms. For example, ""lots of money"" can become ""a lot of money,"" and ""good health"" can simply be ""healthy."" ""Happy family and home"" can become ""happy family"" and then later clarified as including a home","There are two ways to solve this problem. We can use special letter combinations.

Here is the original sentence:
""Please provide me with more information about the new employee , including his or her work experience , job description , and salary .""

And here is the simplified sentence:
""Can you tell me more about the new worker? What did he/she do before? What will he/she do now? How much will he/she earn?""

Note that the simplified sentence still conveys the same information as the original one, but uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it easier to understand. The simplified sentence also focuses on the most important information, omitting some details (e.g. ""or her"" is omitted in the simplified sentence). This way, the main ideas of the original sentence are preserved, but in a more accessible way for A2 CEFR level language learners. I rewrote the sentence as follows:
Original: Please provide me with more information about the new employee, including his or her work experience, job description, and salary.
Rewritten: Can you tell me more about the new worker?

However, this is not a correct simplification of the sentence. The rewritten sentence does not convey the same information as the original one. The original sentence asks for specific information","To solve this problem, you can replace special letters with similar-looking combinations of letters.

Original sentence: You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence needs to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.
Simplified sentence: To make a sentence easier to understand, you can use simpler words, cut out unnecessary details, or break it up into shorter sentences. The new sentence should still make sense and sound natural. 
Note that I've replaced the word ""paraphrasing"" with ""use simpler words"", which is more accessible to B1 level learners. I've also used the phrase ""cut out unnecessary details"" instead of ""compression"", which is a more concrete concept. Additionally, I've rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to follow.

Simple:I've had my new laptop for a long time . I still have scratches on the screen .

Note that this example does not contain any particularly difficult vocabulary or grammar, but rather a somewhat complex structure. However, it's still a good idea to simplify it further to make it more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. Here's another attempt:

Even simpler:My laptop is old . It has scratches on the screen .

This version uses even shorter sentences and avoids any potentially confusing vocabulary or structures. It also focuses on the main idea of the original sentence, which is that the speaker's laptop has scratches on the screen. This should be easy for A1 CEFR level language learners to understand. 

The rewritten text should be: 
My laptop is old. It has scratches on the screen.  I hope it helps! Let me know if you need anything else.","You use your mouth to make someone feel good sexually.

Rewritten sentence: To stop the virus from spreading, hospital staff must follow a special plan when they care for the patient. They must wear special clothes to protect themselves, check the patient's temperature often, and wash their hands carefully when touching the patient's fluids. 

Note: I will be using the rewritten sentence as an example for my answer. 

Here is the rewritten sentence with a glossary at the end:

Original Sentence: 
The doctor said that the patient's symptoms were likely caused by a combination of factors including stress, anxiety, and a viral infection.

Simplified Sentence:
The doctor thinks the patient is sick because of stress, anxiety, and a virus.

Note that the simplified sentence should be easy to understand for an A1 level learner. Here is the breakdown of the original sentence:

* ""The doctor said"" is a simple sentence, but the learner may not know what the doctor said, so we need to simplify the content.
* ""symptoms"" is a noun that might be unfamiliar to the learner, so we can replace it with a simpler word like ""sick"".
* ""likely caused by"" is a phrase that might be difficult to understand, so we can replace it with a simpler phrase like ""is because of"".
* ""a combination of factors"" is a phrase that might be hard to understand, so we can replace it with a simpler phrase like ""stress, anxiety, and a virus"".
* ""including"" is a word that might be unfamiliar to the","Computers now use a new way of counting time that makes calculations easier.

Simplified Sentence:
Modern computers helped solve the problem. They let researchers try different solutions and see what would happen. This helped them make better choices. (Note: The original sentence is around 30 words. The simplified sentence is around 20 words.) The original sentence is quite long and contains several technical terms (e.g., ""computational tools"", ""model and simulate"", ""predict the potential consequences""). To simplify it, we deleted these terms and replaced them with simpler alternatives (e.g., ""modern computers"", ""try different solutions"", ""see what would happen""). We also removed some of the subordinate clauses (e.g., ""in order to"", ""thereby"") to make the sentence shorter and easier to follow.","Computers started using metric time because it is easier to work with.

Simplified sentence:
The rules for using the new technology were still unclear. The government said it was for civilians, not for war. After they explained this, the company could start installing the equipment.  . 

Note: Simplified sentences may not be perfect English, but they should be grammatically correct and convey the same message as the original sentence. In this case, the simplified sentence has been rewritten in the present tense, which is suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners. The original sentence uses the past tense, which might be more suitable for B1 or higher levels. However, the meaning and structure of the simplified sentence have been preserved. 

The original sentence contains some complex vocabulary and phrases, such as ""governing the use of,"" ""required further clarification,"" and ""provided this clarification."" These phrases have been replaced with simpler alternatives in","Police officers can take something only if they think it is connected to a crime.

Here's how I rewrote the sentence:
- I replaced the complex word ""straightforward"" with the simpler synonym ""simple"".
- I changed ""factual texts"" to ""simple texts"", which makes the meaning clearer.
- I deleted the phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"", as it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. 
- I added the phrase ""such as news or articles on their favourite subject"", which provides more context and helps to clarify the meaning. The result is a sentence that is easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners.

Simplified sentence:
The weather will be bad on Saturday. There will be some sunshine on Sunday. It will be windy both days. It will be cold.

Note that the simplified sentence is not word-for-word translation, but rather a reworded version that conveys the same information as the original sentence, but in a way that is more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners. 
The simplified sentence uses shorter sentences, and avoids using complex vocabulary such as ""uncertain"", ""high chance of rain"", ""mix of sunshine and cloud"", and ""around 12-15 degrees Celsius"". Instead, it uses simpler vocabulary like ""bad"", ""some sunshine"", ""windy"", and ""cold"" to convey the same message. 
The simplified sentence also omits some details, such as the exact temperature, to make it easier to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. 
Overall, the simplified sentence","Thieves are stealing plaques because they can sell the metal inside for money.

Or alternatively:
Researchers found out that some parts of the brain we thought were not working are actually doing some things. 

Note that both simplified sentences have retained the main idea of the original sentence, but are more suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners. The first option is a bit more concise, while the second one provides a bit more detail. Both options are grammatically correct, fluent, and easy to understand. The vocabulary used is also simple enough for A2 level learners. 

Here are some explanations for the simplifications:
- ""previously considered non-functional"" has been replaced with ""thought to be useless"" in the first simplified sentence.
- ""previously thought to be controlled by other areas","With scrap metal prices high, thieves are targeting plaques to sell them for money.

The original sentence is: The increasing noise pollution in the city is affecting not only the health of its residents but also the quality of their lives , which is ultimately going to lead to a decrease in the city's population .
Here is the rewritten simplified sentence:
The city is making too much noise . This is bad for people's health and makes their lives worse . In the end , there will be fewer people living in the city . 

Note: The above example assumes that the language learners already know the meaning of ""pollution"", ""residents"", ""health"", ""quality of life"", and ""population"" but might need some additional support with more complex vocabulary like ""decrease"". 

This is a good start, but I'd like to suggest a few minor adjustments to make it even clearer for A1 level language learners. Here is a revised version:

The city is making too much noise . This is bad for people's health . Their lives are becoming unhappy . In the end , there will be fewer people living in the city .

I made the following changes:

* Changed ""makes their lives worse"" to ""becoming unhappy"" to use simpler vocabulary and convey the same idea.
* Removed ""which is ultimately"" as it's","Everyone knew why the plane was shaking at the start.

2. ""discovered that the genetic material from the two organisms is not identical"" is simplified to ""found out that the two living things are not alike"" to reduce the use of complex vocabulary.
3. ""has undergone significant changes"" is replaced with ""have changed a lot"" to make the sentence more conversational and easier to understand.
4. ""through the process of evolution over millions of years"" is simplified to ""over millions of years"" to eliminate unnecessary information and make the sentence more concise. The main idea of the sentence remains intact, but the language is made more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners.","Everyone knew why the plane was shaking during takeoff.

Note: This rewritten sentence conveys the same idea as the original but uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences that an A1 level language learner can understand.  The original sentence is not suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners because it contains complex vocabulary such as ""wafted"", ""enticing"", ""household"", ""overnight"", and ""delicious treats"".

Simplification Process
The simplification process involves breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones by using techniques such as paraphrasing, compression, and splitting. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Paraphrasing**: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms to make the text more accessible. For example, ""information technology"" can become ""computers and phones.""
2.  **Compression**: Delete unnecessary information to focus on the main idea. In the given example, the original sentence mentions three aspects (work, live, communicate), but the simplified version condenses them into a single phrase (""how","There were changes in how medicines are packaged. There are also laws against tampering with medicines.

Here is the original sentence:
""The law requires that all individuals and organizations submit their environmental impact statements to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within a certain time period before commencing any development project that involves federal funding or affects the environment.""

Here is the rewritten sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:
""Before starting a big project that uses government money or hurts the environment, people and companies must send their plans to the EPA."" 

The original sentence has been simplified by:
1. Replacing the word ""individuals"" with ""people""
2. Replacing the phrase ""environmental impact statements"" with ""plans""
3. Replacing the word ""organizations"" with ""companies""
4. Replacing the word ""commencing"" with ""starting""
5. Replacing the phrase ""within a certain time period"" with ""before""
6. Deleting the word ""federal"" (since it is not necessary for understanding)
7. Splitting the long sentence into two simpler ones.
8. Using simpler vocabulary such as ""big project"" instead of ""development project"" and ""hurts the environment"" instead of ""affects the environment"". 

Note that the","These problems led to new rules about how medicines are packaged and to stronger laws against tampering.

Original Sentence: There is a widely held view that the biggest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century are environmental degradation, climate change, and social inequality. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that these issues are closely intertwined and that their causes are often rooted in a more fundamental problem: the unsustainable consumption patterns and production processes of modern capitalism. 
Simplified Sentence: Many people think the biggest problems in the world today are pollution, climate change, and unfairness. But they don't see that these problems are connected and come from a bigger issue: how we live and produce things in our modern society.

Original sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence:
A B1 level language learner can understand simple texts about things they like with enough accuracy.

Explanation:
Original sentence: ""Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension."" This sentence is complex because it uses formal vocabulary (e.g., ""straightforward,"" ""factual,"" ""satisfactory""), and the structure is a bit convoluted. To simplify it, we need to break it down and use more accessible language.
Simplified sentence: ""A B1 level language learner can understand simple texts about things they like with enough accuracy."" Here, we've replaced ""straightforward"" with ""simple,"" ""factual"" with ""about things they like,"" and ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" with ""enough accuracy."" We've also rephrased the sentence to make it more direct and clear. The simplified sentence conveys the same idea as the original but in a way that's easier for B1 level language learners to understand. 

The original sentence is",3,3,4

Original sentence:
The jury foreman explained that the defendant's lawyer had deliberately misled the jury about the key evidence in the case, and therefore the prosecution could not continue with the trial because they were unable to present their case fairly due to the misleading information provided by the defence.

Simplified sentence:
The person in charge of the jury said that the lawyer was wrong. He gave wrong information to the jury. So, the court cannot continue the trial. 

Note: The simplified sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, but uses shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary to make it more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. 

Also, the simplified sentence uses a more conversational tone, which is more suitable for A1 level learners. 

Here are some specific changes made to simplify the sentence:

*   ""The jury foreman"" is replaced with ""the person in charge of the jury"", which is a more common way to refer to this role.
*   ""deliberately misled"" is replaced with ""was","Companies that make bullets offer different kinds for each gun.
Now let's try to simplify the following complex sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:

The biologist studied the effects of pollution on marine life in the polluted waters near the industrial area .

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The key elements of the sentence include the biologist, the study topic (effects of pollution), the location (polluted waters near an industrial area), and the subject of the study (marine life).

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""Biologist"" is a complex word that can be replaced with ""scientist"".
- ""Effects of pollution"" can be simplified to ""how pollution affects"".
- ""Marine life"" can be understood by A2 learners as ""fish and sea creatures"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
The specific location (""polluted waters near the industrial area"") can be simplified to just ""near factories"" since the focus is on the type of environment (polluted) rather than its exact location.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence into several simpler ones
This step is not necessary here because the sentence can be made clear with minimal changes.

## Step 5: Combine the simplified","You can buy bullets in different weights and types for the same gun cartridge. ( Example 5 )

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Original sentence:
The president of the university will meet with students from all departments on campus to discuss their concerns about the new policy.

Simplified sentence:
The university president will talk to students about their worries.

Note: This is a general guideline and may vary depending on the specific context and the learner's proficiency level. For example, the simplified sentence could be further simplified to ""The university president talks to students."" if the learner is a beginner who can only understand very short sentences. I rewrote the original sentence in a way that is easy to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. I replaced the complex phrase ""meet with students from all departments on campus"" with a simpler one ""talk to students"", and also used a more straightforward verb ""discuss"" instead of ""talk about"". I also removed the phrase ""about the new policy"" as it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence. Here is the rewritten sentence:

The university president will talk to students about their worries.","Scorpions have been on Earth for a very long time - over 400 million years.

Original sentence: The tourist industry in many countries has grown rapidly over the past few decades, but the environmental impact of tourism is not always well understood, and this lack of understanding can lead to negative consequences, such as pollution, over-tourism, and damage to local ecosystems.
Simplified sentence: Tourism has grown quickly in many countries, but it can harm the environment if we don't understand how it works.

This sentence is rewritten using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. The original sentence contained complex vocabulary such as ""environmental impact"", ""negative consequences"", and ""local ecosystems"". These words are replaced with simpler synonyms such as ""harm the environment"" and ""damage the place"". Additionally, the sentence is split into two simpler sentences to make it easier to follow. The first sentence states that tourism has grown quickly, and the second sentence explains the potential harm caused by tourism if not managed properly. This way, the main ideas of the original sentence are retained without overwhelming the A2 CEFR level language learner with complex vocabulary and sentence structures. The final simplified sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and easy to understand. 

The final answer is: Tourism has grown quickly in many","Scorpions have been around for 430 million years.

Here is the sentence that you need to simplify: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The sentence is describing what a B1 level language learner can do in terms of reading comprehension.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""B1 level language learner"" can be simplified to ""a person at an intermediate level of language learning"".
- ""straightforward factual texts"" can be simplified to ""simple facts and information"".
- ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be simplified to ""well enough to understand"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
- The phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" is not crucial to understanding the main idea of what a B1 learner can do.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence into simpler ones
- Break down the sentence into two simpler sentences:
1. A person at an intermediate level of language learning can read simple facts and information.
2. They can understand these things well enough.

## Step 5: Check for grammaticality, fluency,",3,3,3

Can you simplify this sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners?

## Step 1: Identify the main ideas
The main ideas of the sentence are about a new employee feeling nervous and excited on his first day of work, being anxious about making mistakes, and trying to be friendly and confident.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""extremely nervous"" can be replaced with ""very scared""
- ""first day of work"" can be replaced with ""his first day""
- ""anxious about making mistakes"" can be replaced with ""afraid to make mistakes""
- ""being judged by them"" can be replaced with ""being watched by his new colleagues""

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
- The phrase ""but he was also very excited about the opportunity to learn new things and meet his new colleagues"" is somewhat redundant with the","However, we can't be sure about conventions because they're not written down.

Here is the original sentence:
The water level in rivers can be affected by a number of factors , including changes in precipitation , the amount of water that flows from the surrounding land , and the flow rate of the river itself . Moreover , the water level can also be influenced by human activities such as damming or dredging , which can alter the natural flow of the river . Additionally , human actions like pollution or over-extraction of water can further affect the water level . Therefore , the water level in rivers can be unpredictable due to these various factors .
And here is a rewritten version of the sentence at the A2 level:
The water level in rivers can change. It can go up or down because of rain, how much water is around, and how fast the river flows. Humans can also make changes to the river. For example, they can build dams or move rocks. This can change the way the water flows. If humans pollute the water or take too much of it, this can also affect the water level. So, the water level in rivers can be hard to predict.

Note that I have used simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""change"" instead of ""affected"", ""go","People argue about whether or not conventions are real and should be followed.

The original sentence is: B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified version: B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about things they like with a good understanding. 
Note: In this example, the word ""straightforward"" is replaced with ""simple"", and the phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" is replaced with ""with a good understanding"". This makes the sentence more accessible to B1 CEFR level language learners. 

The final answer is: B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about things they like with a good understanding.",3,3,3

Note that the simplified sentences may sound unnatural or less idiomatic than the original ones. However, they should still be grammatically correct and retain the main ideas of their original counterparts. Here is the rewritten simplified sentence:
I tried to eat the food that my friend gave me, but it was too spicy and made my mouth feel very hot and uncomfortable, so I had to drink some milk to calm down my tongue and throat.

The researchers who studied the effects of climate change on the Amazon rainforest used various methods to collect data, including satellite imagery, field observations, and interviews with local communities, but the most accurate results came from combining all these methods together, which was a challenging task because the data from each source had different formats and scales, making it difficult to compare them directly.

Simplification:
The researchers who studied the Amazon rainforest and climate change collected data in three ways: using satellites, observing the forest, and talking to local people. To get good results, they had to put all the data together. This was hard because the data was in different forms and sizes.

Note: In the original sentence, the word ""neusis"" is not present, but the sentence still needs to be simplified for A2 CEFR level language learners.

Here's how we can do it:

- Replace complex words with simpler ones
- Leave out unnecessary information
- Break a long sentence into shorter ones

I have tried rewriting the sentence myself but I am not confident that my version is good enough. Here is my attempt at rewriting the sentence:
Complex:It is essential that you keep all the information in the letter confidential because it contains sensitive personal data about employees and their families , which must be protected according to our company policy .
Simple:Please keep this letter private. It has important information about our workers.

I feel that my version is not perfect because I didn't explicitly mention the reason why the information should be kept private (i.e. ""it has important information about our workers""). However, I was worried that mentioning ""sensitive personal data"" would be too complex for an A2 level learner. Do you think my version is good enough or should I try to simplify it further? 

Also, please note that the sentence is a formal business letter.","In Germany, the first two numbers on your ID card show which state you live in.

It also contains the word ""comprehension"", which may not be familiar to all learners. The simplified sentence replaces these phrases with more everyday language that is easier to understand. The simplified sentence also removes the word ""satisfactory"" which is not commonly used in everyday conversation. 
The simplified sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, but in a way that is more accessible to B1 level language learners. 

I rewrote the sentence to make it easier to understand by B1 CEFR level language learners. Here's the rewritten sentence:

Note that these simplified sentences still convey the same idea as the original sentence but in a much clearer and more straightforward way. They avoid using complex vocabulary (e.g., ""abstract"") and instead opt for simpler language that is more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. The resulting sentences are also shorter and more concise, making them easier to follow and understand. 
The final answer is: Time is hard to understand . People think about it differently . (or) Time is hard to understand . We think about it in different ways .  (or) Time is hard to understand .

Note: The two simplified sentences above have been rewritten to convey the same meaning as the original sentence but with a more straightforward and simpler vocabulary and structure suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners. The first simplified sentence uses the phrase ""tiny living things"" to replace the more complex phrase ""microorganisms"", while the second simplified sentence uses the word ""organisms"" directly. Both simplified sentences use shorter sentences to make the text easier to understand. 

The final answer is: There are two possible simplified versions of the sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners, both of which","Gunfire can be mistaken for other loud noises like fireworks and car backfires.

Original sentence: B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Original sentence:You can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to your field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence:You can easily understand simple texts about things that interest you.

Explanation: 
- ""straightforward factual texts"" is replaced by ""simple texts"", as 'factual' implies something true or based on facts, but doesn't necessarily mean it's easy to read.
- ""related to your field of interest"" is simplified to ""things that interest you"", which is a more common way to express this idea.

Here is the complex sentence you need to simplify:

The sociologist found that the low-income families in the urban area had limited access to public transportation , and therefore they could not easily get to work or school on time .

## Step 1: Identify the main idea
The main idea of the sentence is that low-income families in an urban area have difficulty getting to work or school because they lack access to public transportation.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""Sociologist"" can be replaced with ""researcher"".
- ""Low-income families"" can be simplified to ""poor families"".
- ""Limited access"" can be replaced with ""no easy way to"".
- ""Public transportation"" can be simplified to ""buses or trains"".
- ""Could not easily get to work or school"" can be paraphrased as ""had trouble getting to work or school"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
- The phrase ""in the urban area"" provides context but is not crucial to understanding the main idea.

## Step 4: Split the sentence into simpler ones if necessary
Given the complexity of the sentence, breaking it down into two simpler sentences might improve clarity:

I'd be happy to help with any other sentences you'd like to simplify. 
Let me know if you need further assistance. 

Also, please note that the simplified sentence might not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding as the original sentence, but it should still be understandable for B1 CEFR level language learners. If you want to make the simplified sentence more idiomatic, you could try rephrasing it using more common expressions or phrasing. For example:

Original sentence:
The city council voted to raise the tax on large businesses , but the mayor vetoed the bill , and the council could not override the veto , so the tax increase will not happen .

Simplified sentence:
The city council wanted to increase taxes on big companies. The mayor said no. So, the tax increase won't happen.  The city council cannot change the mayor's decision. Therefore, the tax increase will not happen.  The city council voted to increase taxes on big companies. The mayor disagreed. The tax increase will not happen because the city council cannot change the mayor's decision. 
(Note: The above simplified sentences are not exactly the same but convey the same meaning as the original sentence.) The original sentence is complex because it contains several clauses, some of which are subordinate (i.e., ""but the mayor vetoed the bill,"" ""so the tax increase will not happen""). It also uses formal vocabulary such as ""vetoed"" and ""override."" To simplify the sentence, we need to replace these complex elements with simpler ones. One way to do this is to break the sentence down into shorter, more manageable pieces. For example, we can start with the first clause","By 1851 , there were 15 small planets in space. Most had their own special sign.

Original sentence: “The museum is located on a hill overlooking the city, and the building has been renovated recently; however, the interior still maintains the old architectural style of the original building, which was designed by a famous architect in the early 20th century.”

The word ""despite"" means ""even though"", ""significant"" means ""very important"", ""abandoning"" means ""stopping"" or ""giving up"", and ""too high"" means ""very expensive"". Note that some information has been deleted in order to make the sentence simpler. For example, the fact that the cost of abandoning the project is compared to its benefits is not explicitly stated in the simplified sentence. However, this comparison is implied.

Here's the complex sentence you'd like me to simplify: 
B1 level language learners Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
I will rewrite this sentence in simpler language, making sure it retains the main ideas and is grammatically correct.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The sentence describes what B1 level language learners can do in terms of reading comprehension. The key elements are ""B1 level language learners"", ""read straightforward factual texts"", ""on subjects related to their field of interest"", and ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"".

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""B1 level language learners"" can be simplified to ""people learning English at a certain level"".
- ""straightforward factual texts"" can be simplified to ""simple true stories"".
- ""subjects related to their field of interest"" can be simplified to ""things they want to learn about"".
- ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be simplified to ""well enough to understand"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information (compression)
The phrase ""Can read"" is a verb phrase that indicates",3,3,3
The central technique of the Socratic method is called an elenchus .,5,"This method asks questions to find the answer.

### Step 1: Identify the main idea of the original sentence.
The main idea of the original sentence is that a serekh is used to show the name of the pharaoh.

### Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms.
- ""serekh"" can be replaced with ""a picture or sign""
- ""royal crest"" can be replaced with ""a symbol of the king""
- ""name of the pharaoh"" can be replaced with ""the king's name""

### Step 3: Delete unimportant information (compression).
We don't need to mention that it is ""normally used"" because it's not crucial to understanding what a serekh is.

### Step 4: Split a long complex sentence into several simpler ones if necessary.
In this case, the sentence is already quite simple and doesn't need to be split.

### Step 5: Make sure the simplified sentence is grammatical and fluent.
The simplified sentence should read: ""A serekh is a symbol of the king. It shows the king's name.""

However, to make it even more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners, we could further simplify it by removing the word ""symbol"" and making","This method uses questions to find the answer.

	+ ""central focus"" becomes ""main goal""
	+ ""scientific research"" becomes ""about science""
	+ ""highly skilled scientists and engineers"" becomes ""students""
	+ ""innovative solutions"" becomes ""solve big environmental problems""

The original sentence contains several complex elements that need to be simplified, including technical terms like ""CEFR level,"" ""straightforward factual texts,"" and ""satisfactory level of comprehension."" It also includes a specific reference to the learner's field of interest.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
Replace ""CEFR level"" with ""their current level,"" ""straightforward factual texts"" with ""simple texts,"" and ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" with ""easily understand.""

## Step 1: Identify the main idea of the original sentence
The main idea of the original sentence is that B1 level language learners have the ability to comprehend straightforward factual texts within their area of interest.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
Replace ""straightforward"" with ""simple"", ""factual texts"" with ""texts about facts"", and ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" with ""understand them well enough"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
The phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" is somewhat redundant given the context, but it's better to keep it for clarity. However, we can rephrase it slightly for better flow.

## Step 4: Split a long complex sentence into several simpler ones
The original sentence is already relatively simple, so no splitting is necessary.

## Step 5: Ensure the simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the",3,3,3

## Step 1: Identify the main ideas
The main ideas in the sentence are: 2010 TK7 is a big rock from space, and it is old.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""Asteroid"" can be replaced with ""rock"".
- ""Diameter"" can be understood as ""size"".
- ""Approximately"" can be omitted since we're not concerned with precise measurements at this level.
- ""Relic"" means something old, so ""old"" is a suitable replacement.

Original sentence: A 2006 study published in the journal Nature revealed that chimpanzees use sticks to extract termites from mounds, but they do not use tools in the same way as humans do; instead, they use sticks as probes to gather termites in a controlled manner. This is an example of convergent evolution, where unrelated species develop similar traits as a result of adapting to similar environments. For example, the octopus has developed a similar ability to use tools, such as collecting and using shells to build shelters.
Simplified sentence: A study found out that chimpanzees use sticks to get termites from their homes. They don't use tools like we do, but they use sticks to pick up termites carefully. This is like something that happened to the octopus too. It uses shells to build its home. This shows that different animals can develop similar ways of doing things if they live in the same kind of environment.
Note that the simplified sentence is shorter, uses simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""get"" instead of ""extract"", ""pick up"" instead of ""gather""), and omits some details (e.g. the fact that the study was","When we are babies or young children, our thymus gland is big and works well.

### Step 1: Identify the main idea
The main idea of the original sentence is to simplify it for A1 CEFR level language learners, which means we need to break down complex vocabulary and sentence structures.

### Step 5: Check the grammaticality, fluency, and retention of the main ideas
The simplified sentence should still convey the same meaning as the original sentence. In this case, the simplified sentence ""It shows the name of the king."" retains","He became consul in 120 because he had done well in his other jobs.

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: At this level, you can easily read simple texts about things you like and understand them well enough. 

Explanation of simplification:
- Original sentence uses the word 'straightforward', which might be difficult for B1 learners to understand. I replaced it with 'simple' to make it more accessible.

- 'Subjects related to their field of interest' is a bit formal and may confuse learners. I rephrased it as 'things you like' to make it more informal and relatable.
- 'Satisfactory level of comprehension' is quite formal and technical, so I changed it to 'understand them well enough' to make it clearer and more conversational. 

Note that the simplified sentence still conveys the same idea as the original sentence, but in a way that's easier for B1 learners to understand.

Note: In the simplified sentences above, the focus is on the learner (people learning English) rather than the level of comprehension (satisfactory level). This makes the sentence more relatable and accessible to B1 level language learners. Additionally, the use of everyday language (e.g., ""simple texts"", ""understand them well enough"") helps to make the sentence more understandable. The main idea remains the same, but the language is adjusted to suit the B1 CEFR level. 

The final answer is: People",4,2,3
The seventeenth century saw a culinary revolution which transported French gastronomy into the modern era .,5,"French food changed a lot in the 17th century.

Original sentence:
The archaeological record suggests that the Egyptian royal tombs were often decorated with scenes depicting various aspects of the life of the pharaoh , including his marriage , coronation , and military campaigns , and that the serekh was normally used as a royal crest , showing the name of the pharaoh .

Simplified sentence:
The tombs of Egyptian kings show pictures of their lives . These pictures include their weddings , becoming king , and wars . It shows the name of the king . (Note: the word 'serekh' has been replaced with 'shows the name of the king'.) 

This revised sentence retains the main idea of the original sentence, i.e. that the tombs of Egyptian kings show pictures of their lives and the name of the king, while using simpler vocabulary and sentence structure suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners.  The new sentence still conveys the idea that the tombs contain depictions of the pharaoh's life events, including his marriage, coronation, and military campaigns, but uses more accessible language to convey this message. 
(Note: The sentence has been revised to use present tense instead of past tense, to make it more suitable for A1 level","In the 1600s, there was a big change in how people cooked in France.

Here is the complex sentence that needs to be rewritten:

Simple:Tourists forgot their cameras at the hotel, but they remembered their phones and took pictures with them.

Note: I have rewritten the sentence in two different ways to demonstrate how the same idea can be expressed using different levels of simplicity. The first option is still a bit more complex than what an A2 learner might be able to understand, but it's closer to the original sentence. The second option is even simpler and more suitable for an A2 learner. 
Option 1: Tourists forgot their cameras at the hotel, but they remembered their phones and used them to take pictures of the nice views.

Option 2: Tourists forgot their cameras, but they took pictures with their phones. 

Let me know if you would like me to make any further adjustments! 
=================================
Here are some additional suggestions to make the text even clearer for A2 learners:
- Use shorter sentences or phrases.
- Use everyday","In the 17th century, there was a big change in French cooking that made it more modern.

Now it's your turn! Please simplify the following sentence for B1 CEFR level language learners:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: _______________________________________________________

## Step 1: Identify the main idea of the sentence
The main idea of the sentence is about the reading ability of B1 level language learners.

## Step 2: Simplify the complex vocabulary
The word ""factual"" can be replaced with ""straightforward"". The phrase ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be replaced with ""well"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
The word ""B1 level language learner"" is already simple, but we can rephrase it as ""people learning English at an intermediate level"".

## Step 4: Split the long sentence into several simpler ones
We can break down the sentence into two parts: ""People learning English at an intermediate level can read straightforward texts"" and ""They understand these texts well"".

## Step 5: Combine the simplified parts
Here is the simplified sentence: People learning English at an intermediate level can read",2,3,3

Complex:Examination of the immediate environs reveals a concentration of ancient sites , including temples , tombs , and other archaeological remains , which were likely built during the occupation of the site by the Early Dynastic Period .
Simple:There are many old buildings near here. (Note: This is a very rough translation, as the original text has a lot of specific details that are lost in this simplification.)

However, I would like to suggest a more detailed simplification, that retains more of the original information:
Simple:There are many old buildings near here. They are temples, graves and other old things. They were probably built a long time ago when people first lived here. (This version still conveys the idea of there being many old buildings, but also gives a sense of what they are and when they might have been built.) 
Alternatively, you could also split the sentence into two simpler ones:
Simple:There are many old buildings near here.
Simple:They are temples, graves and other old things. They were probably built a long time ago","Only a few pyramids are still standing today.

Original sentence: The excavation of the site revealed a number of important artefacts, including a large stone statue of a king, which was discovered in the southern part of the site, but unfortunately, it was found broken in several pieces, and the head was missing.
Simplified sentence: We found some important things at the site. One of them was a big stone king. It was broken into many pieces. Its head was gone.

The original sentence is too complex for A1 CEFR level language learners because it contains:
- A technical term 'excavation' that may be unfamiliar to non-experts
- A compound adjective 'large stone' that might be hard to understand
- An idiomatic expression 'broken in several pieces'
- A passive construction 'was found'
- A subordinate clause 'which was discovered in the southern part of the site' that is not essential to the main idea of the sentence

The simplified sentence avoids these complexities by using more general vocabulary, deleting unnecessary information, and changing the sentence structure to make it more straightforward. 
The simplified sentence still conveys the main ideas","This type of duck is medium-sized and a bit heavier than others. 

Now, let's simplify the given sentence:
Original sentence: I am planning to travel to Europe this summer because I have been studying English for three years now and I think my language skills are good enough to communicate effectively with native speakers.

Note: You may need to adjust your answer based on the specific context and content of the original sentence. 

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else! 

Here is the list of changes I made:

*   Replaced the word ""planning"" with ""going"" to make the sentence more conversational.
*   Simplified the phrase ""travel to Europe this summer"" to make it clearer and more direct.
*   Changed ""studying"" to ""learning"" to make the verb more accessible to A2 learners.

Simplified: Learners at this level can read simple factual texts about things they like and understand them well enough.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the original sentence
The original sentence contains several complex elements: ""Can read straightforward factual texts,"" ""on subjects related to their field of interest,"" and ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension."" These elements need to be broken down and simplified.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""straightforward"" can be replaced with ""simple""
- ""factual texts"" can be replaced with ""information or texts""
- ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be replaced with ""understand them well enough""

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
The phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" can be considered somewhat redundant since the context of ""field of interest"" implies the subject matter is relevant to the learner. Therefore, it can be deleted for simplicity.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence",2,3,3

Original Sentence:
The Egyptian pantheon of gods was complex and multifaceted, with each god having multiple roles and responsibilities; for example, the goddess Isis was associated with magic, fertility, and protection, while the god Anubis was associated with mummification and the afterlife, and the god Ra was associated with the sun and kingship, but also with chaos and evil. The serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the pharaoh, and the cartouche was used to surround the name of the pharaoh, indicating that the text was about the ruler. By the 4th millennium BC, the Egyptians were able to create more sophisticated writing systems, including hieroglyphics, which allowed them to write longer texts and tell more complex stories. Yet another prominent example of an introduced species that became invasive is the European rabbit in Australia, but the process of becoming invasive takes a long time and involves many factors.

The world's most massive terrestrial animal of the Eocene epoch was the Indricotherium, a type of giant rhinoceros that lived in Asia during this time. However, despite its massive size, it was not a formidable predator; rather, it was primarily a grazer, feeding on the abundant vegetation of the region. In fact, the Indricotherium was a plant-eater that consumed an enormous amount of food to sustain its massive body weight, which is estimated to have been around 15-20 tons. In comparison, the average adult human weighs about 70 kilograms. In contrast, the Indricotherium was a much smaller animal than the giant sauropod dinosaurs that roamed the Earth during the same time period, but its massive size still allowed it to dominate the ecosystem as a grazer. The Indricotherium was a key species in its ecosystem, playing a crucial role in shaping the evolution of the region's flora and fauna.
