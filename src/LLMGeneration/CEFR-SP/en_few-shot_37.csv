*   Replace the complex word ""straightforward"" with a simpler synonym like ""easy to understand""
*   Replace the complex phrase ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" with a simpler phrase like ""well enough to understand""
*   Split the long complex sentence into two simpler ones

The final simplified sentence would be:

B1 level language learners can read easy-to-understand factual texts about their interests well enough to understand them.

The final answer is B1 level language learners can read easy-to-understand factual texts about their interests well enough","They could see the astronauts coming back and reached the landing place fast.

The teacher asked the students to explain the purpose of their projects and to justify why they had chosen a particular topic or theme. Simplified sentence:
The teacher asked the students to tell why they chose their project's idea and what it was about. Explanation: I replaced the complex words ""explain"", ""purpose"", ""justify"" with simpler synonyms like ""tell"", ""idea"", and ""what it was about"". I also removed the word ""particular"" which is not essential to understanding the main idea of the sentence. I split the long sentence into two shorter ones, each conveying a main idea. The resulting simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of the original sentence without changing its meaning. A2 level language learners should be able to understand this simplified sentence because it contains short, simple vocabulary and is easy to follow. Note: The teacher asked the students to tell why they chose","They saw the astronauts come down and landed quickly.

In this example, the simplified sentence is more suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners because it uses simpler vocabulary (e.g. 'leaders' instead of 'executives', 'doing something wrong' instead of 'corrupt scheme', 'paid' instead of 'bribing') and shorter sentences. It also retains the main ideas of the original sentence.

The rewritten sentence is easier to understand because it:
-uses simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""study"" instead of ""studying"")
-has fewer clauses (i.e. it's shorter)
-has a clearer structure (i.e. each sentence has only one main idea)

Here is the rewritten sentence in an even simpler form:
I learn English for three years . I don't pass my exam . I will try again next year .

This rewritten sentence uses even simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""learn"" instead of ""study"") and is even shorter and clearer. However, it may lose some nuances of the original sentence, such as the implication that the speaker has been making an effort to study English for three years. The goal is to make the sentence easy to understand while still retaining the main ideas of the original sentence.

Original sentence:Some people believe that the universe began from a single point, called a singularity, about 13.8 billion years ago, when matter as we know it today did not exist; they think that this singularity expanded rapidly, and then continued to expand at an ever-increasing rate, a process known as inflation, during which the universe cooled and particles began to form. Others think that the universe has no beginning and has always existed in some form.

Simplified sentence:Some people think that the universe started from a tiny point about 13.8 billion years ago. They believe that this point grew quickly and then kept growing faster and faster. As it grew, the universe got cooler and smaller particles formed. Other people think that the universe has always been here and never had a beginning.

Note: The simplified sentence uses a more straightforward structure and avoids complex vocabulary such as ""singularity,"" ""inflation,"" and ""matter.""

Original sentence:
The study found that people who were overweight had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease , including heart disease , high blood pressure , and stroke , compared to those who were not overweight .

Simplified sentence:
People who are overweight are more likely to get heart problems . 

Explanation:
In this example, I used a synonym for ""cardiovascular disease"" which is ""heart problems"". I also deleted the names of specific diseases such as ""heart disease"", ""high blood pressure"", and ""stroke"" because they are not necessary to convey the main idea. I also used a more general term ""get"" instead of ""developing"" to make it easier to understand. Finally, I changed the complex sentence structure to a simple one (""are more likely to get"") to make it easier to follow. 
The simplified sentence still conveys the same main idea as the original one: being overweight increases the risk of getting heart problems. The simplified sentence is also grammatically correct,",2,3,3
"However , because conventions are not textually based , their existence and practice are open to debate .",4,"But because conventions are not written down , people disagree about them.

The final answer is Some areas had violent thunderstorms. Other areas were nice and sunny. # Step 2 : Determine the most suitable way to simplify the sentence
There are several ways to simplify a sentence, including:

*   Replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (paraphrasing)
*   Deleting unnecessary information (compression)
*   Breaking a long complex sentence into several simpler ones

Step 3: Rewrite the sentence using the chosen method(s) of simplification
For example, let's take the original sentence: ""B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.""
Using paraphrasing, we can replace the complex word ""satisfactory"" with a simpler synonym like ""good"".
Using compression, we can delete the phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" because it's not crucial to the main idea.
Using breaking into simpler sentences, we can split the original sentence into two separate ones:
""B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts.""
""They can do this on subjects related to their field of interest.""
The final answer is B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts. They can do this on subjects related","Conventions are not always clear, so people disagree about them.

Original sentence:
The researchers' results were published in a special issue of the Journal of Neuroscience in 2017 and were subsequently discussed in a debate on BBC Radio 4's flagship programme 'The Today Programme' on 12 April 2017.

Simplified sentence:
The scientists' results were published in a magazine in 2017. They talked about these results on the radio on 12 April 2017.

Note: The simplified sentence has been rewritten in the passive voice, which is more suitable for A2 level language learners. In the original sentence, the subject is 'the researchers', whereas in the simplified sentence, the subject is 'the scientists'. This change has been made to make the sentence easier to understand. 

The simplified sentence has also been shortened by deleting the phrase 'flagship programme' and the word 'subsequently', as they may be unfamiliar to A2 level language learners. 

Finally, the phrase 'Journal of Neuroscience' has been replaced with 'magazine' to make the sentence more accessible to A2 level language learners. 

The simplified sentence retains the main ideas of the original sentence, including the publication of the results in 2017 and the discussion on the radio on","Some people have different ideas about conventions.

Here is the original complex sentence: If you don't like the hotel room , I can ask my friend to change it for us . Here is the simplified version of the sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners: I don't like the hotel room . Can you change it ?

## Step 1: Identify the main idea of the original sentence
The main idea of the original sentence is that if someone doesn't like their hotel room, they can ask the speaker's friend to change it for them.

## Step 2: Determine what makes the original sentence complex

The researchers used advanced computer simulations to study the effects of climate change on ocean currents and sea levels over the next century. The results showed that sea levels could rise by up to 90 centimeters in the next hundred years, causing widespread flooding in coastal areas. However, the researchers also found that the rate of sea-level rise would depend on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere. If the emissions are reduced significantly, the rate of sea-level rise would be slower. But if the emissions continue to increase, the rate of sea-level rise would be faster. The researchers concluded that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Simplified Sentence:
Scientists used computers to study what will happen to the sea and the weather over the next 100 years. Their research showed that the sea could rise by 90 centimeters in the next 100 years.

Step 2: Determine the complexity of the sentence

The original sentence is complex because it contains a subordinate clause (""while other areas experienced beautiful weather"") and uses the conjunction ""and"" to connect two clauses with different meanings.

Step 3: Simplify the sentence by breaking it down into smaller parts

Original sentence: In some areas, there were violent thunderstorms while other areas experienced beautiful weather.
Breakdown:
- Some areas had violent thunderstorms.
- Other areas were nice and sunny.

Step 4: Choose the simplest form of the sentence

Based on the breakdown, the simplest form of the sentence would be:
Some areas had violent thunderstorms. Other areas were nice and sunny.

However, considering the context of the question which asks for a single sentence, we can merge the two simple sentences into one:
Some areas had violent thunderstorms while others were nice and sunny.

But for a B1 level language learner, it might be more suitable to have two separate sentences as in step 3:

Simplified sentence:
A new company has come to our town. They want to help the local economy and give people work. But some people are worried that the company might harm the environment, especially if they build a big factory near the river.

Explanation:
1. The original sentence contains a complex sentence structure with multiple clauses (e.g., ""which has just started to operate,"" ""but many people are worried""). To simplify, I broke the sentence into two shorter sentences, focusing on the main ideas.
2. The phrase ""heavily in the local economy"" is a bit complex, so I changed it to a more straightforward expression ""help the local economy.""
3. The phrase ""the company's environmental impact could be very bad"" is also complex, so I simplified it to ""harm the environment.""

*   ""to the store"" was replaced with ""to the shop"" (using a more common word for a store) to make it easier to understand.
*   ""because I want to buy"" was deleted (compression) since it's implied that the person is going to the shop to buy something.
*   ""some milk and eggs"" was left as is since it's a clear and simple phrase that A1 level learners can understand.

The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence.  The main idea is that the speaker is going to the shop to buy some essential items.  This sentence should be understandable for A1 CEFR level language learners.",2,2,3

The highly controversial topic of euthanasia, which involves the practice of intentionally ending a person's life, is a subject of great debate among ethicists, doctors, lawyers, and politicians worldwide. Some ethicists believe that euthanasia is morally justifiable when a patient has a terminal illness, is suffering greatly, and has no hope of recovery. Others argue that euthanasia is never acceptable, as it violates human dignity and the right to life. Furthermore, many doctors and lawyers oppose euthanasia because they believe that it would lead to abuse and the exploitation of vulnerable patients. Additionally, some politicians argue that euthanasia should be legalized only in cases where there is clear evidence that the patient's suffering cannot be alleviated through other means. On the other hand, some ethicists and doctors argue that euthanasia is a necessary evil in certain situations, such as when a patient is in extreme pain and unable to communicate their wishes.

The original sentence contains complex vocabulary such as ""lent"" and ""broken down"". It also has multiple clauses (""but"", ""so"") that make it difficult to follow.

Additionally, we can split the sentence into two separate sentences to make it easier to understand.

Here is the sentence you need to simplify:
The researchers used a complex statistical method to analyze the data from the 20th-century climate change studies.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The key elements of the sentence are the researchers, the method they used, and the purpose of using this method (analyzing data from climate change studies).

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""complex"" can be replaced with ""special""
- ""statistical"" can be replaced with ""mathematical""
- ""analyze"" can remain as it's a high-frequency word but could be rephrased for clarity

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
- ""20th-century"" is specific detail that might confuse an A2 level learner; it can be omitted for simplicity.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence into simpler ones if necessary
However, the sentence is already quite straightforward, so no splitting is required.

## Step 5: Create the simplified sentence
Using the steps above, the sentence can be simplified as follows:

The given complex sentence is: The rising cost of fuel is one of the main reasons why the price of food has gone up, and this is because the production of food is very dependent on the cost of fuel. The transportation of food from the farm to the shops also depends on the cost of fuel, and so does the packaging and distribution of food.

Here's the rewritten text in a simpler version for A2 CEFR level language learners:
The price of food is going up. One reason for this is that fuel is expensive. Food producers need fuel to grow their crops. They also need fuel to transport their food to shops. Shops use fuel to package and deliver food to people. If fuel is expensive, it costs more to produce, transport, and sell food. This is why the price of food is increasing.

The final answer is Some areas had violent thunderstorms. Other areas were nice and sunny. # Step 2: Identify the complex elements in the sentence

The sentence contains several complex elements:
- The phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" is complex because it uses a formal expression that might be unfamiliar to B1 level learners.
- The phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" is also complex because it uses a formal expression that might be difficult for B1 level learners to understand.
- The sentence structure is also complex because it contains a subordinate clause (""You can do so by..."") and a main clause (""B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts..."").

Step 3: Simplify the complex elements

To simplify the sentence, we can replace the complex phrases with simpler expressions:
- Instead of ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"", we can say ""well enough"".
- Instead of ""on subjects related to their field of interest"", we can say ""about things they like"".
- We can rephrase the sentence to make it more straightforward and easy to"," Duroplast is a strong plastic.

Note: This is an example of compression and paraphrasing. The simplified sentence still conveys the same idea as the original sentence but uses shorter and simpler sentences. The most important information (the reason why the project is delayed) is retained, while the less important details (the exact time frame of the project) are deleted. The word ""crucial"" is replaced with ""important"", which is a simpler synonym. The phrase ""complete the study"" is also paraphrased to ""finish it"", which is a more common expression in everyday language. 

The final answer is: A group of researchers have been working on a new project for several months. They still need more information before they can finish it. They are waiting for this important data. Read less

The given complex sentence is: The number of people who don't have health insurance has increased over the past five years, and this has resulted in an increase in the number of people who need medical treatment but cannot afford it, which has put a strain on the healthcare system. 

Simplification: 
The number of people without health insurance has gone up over the last five years. This has caused problems for many people who need medical help but can't pay for it. As a result, the healthcare system is under a lot of pressure. 
Alternatively:
Many people don't have health insurance. This means they can't afford medical treatment when they need it. So, the healthcare system is getting more and more stressed. 

In both simplified versions, I used compression by deleting some details (e.g. ""over the past five years"", ""resulted in an increase in the number of people who need medical treatment but cannot afford it"", and ""which has put a strain on the healthcare system"") and replaced complex words or phrases with simpler ones (e.g.",4,4,4

or 
The policeman had to write a report after talking to people who saw the crime. However, these people gave different accounts of what happened during the robbery. 

Note: The first simplified sentence is more suitable for beginners while the second one is better for intermediate A2 level learners. The second one uses the phrase ""different accounts"" which requires some vocabulary knowledge of idiomatic expressions. 
The main idea remains the same, but the simplified sentence is easier to understand due to the use of shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary. The A2 level learner can still grasp the essential information of the original sentence without getting lost in the complexity of the text. The simplified sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, making it easy for the learner to comprehend and follow.

I try to find out what the writer wants to tell me, and then I read the rest of the sentence again to see how it supports this idea. Another strategy I use is to break down the sentence into smaller parts. If I see a long complicated sentence, I will try to identify the different clauses and phrases that make it up. This helps me to understand the sentence more easily. I also try to look for familiar words and phrases in the sentence. If I see a word or phrase that I know, it helps me to understand the rest of the sentence. Finally, I try to read the sentence out loud. This helps me to hear the rhythm and the stress on the different words, which makes it easier for me to understand. By using these strategies, I have",2,2,3

The fact that a large number of women are now working outside the home has led to a significant increase in the number of divorces in many countries around the world.

Many women work outside the home now. This has led to more divorces in many countries. But it's not because women want to be free.

Simplified sentence: I study English for five years, but some words are difficult for me because they have many meanings. (This version is more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners.) 
The simplified sentence has fewer words than the original one. It uses shorter sentences, and also employs simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""study"" instead of ""have been studying""). Also, the original sentence's idiomatic expression (""have trouble understanding"") is replaced with a more literal expression (""are difficult for me"").The sentence structure is also changed from a complex sentence with a subordinate clause to two simple sentences joined by a conjunction (""but""). This makes the sentence easier to follow and understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. Finally, the main idea of the original sentence is retained, but the new version focuses more on the difficulty of understanding certain words rather than the length of time spent studying English. This change makes the sentence more relatable and accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners.

Here is the complex sentence to be rewritten:

The university's administration has decided that students will not be allowed to take their cars on campus starting from next semester due to increasing traffic congestion and parking problems . 
Rewritten text for A2 level language learners:
The university won't let students bring their cars onto campus from next semester because there's too much traffic and not enough parking spaces. 

Note: In this example, I used the word 'campus' which is an academic vocabulary item, but it is a common term in many countries, and therefore I kept it. If you want to use a more basic vocabulary, you could say 'university grounds'. However, keep in mind that the sentence may become less idiomatic. Another option would be to say 'university', as in 'The university won't let students bring their cars onto the university from next semester...' but this would change the meaning slightly, implying that the car cannot enter the university building itself. 
Please let me know if you need further assistance. I'd be happy to help.  I'm looking forward to your feedback. Have a great day!

Complex:However, the new legislation introduced a comprehensive overhaul of the existing tax system, which included the implementation of a novel income tax and a more progressive tax rate, resulting in a significant increase in revenue for the government, and simultaneously reducing the tax burden on low-income households.

Simplified:
New laws changed the old way of paying taxes. They added a new tax and made the tax rates fairer. This means the government gets more money. It also helps people who don't earn much money. 

Alternatively, you could break this complex sentence into two simpler ones:

New laws changed the old way of paying taxes. They added a new tax and made the tax rates fairer, so the government gets more money and people who don't earn much pay less. 

Or, another option is to use shorter sentences:

The new laws changed the tax system. They added a new tax and made the tax rates fairer. This helped the government and people who don't earn much money.

Original sentence: Many people believe that eating too much sugar causes diabetes, but some doctors think that is not true. 
Simplified sentence: Some people think sugar makes you sick, but doctors don't agree. 

Here's how I'd simplify the original sentence for an A1 CEFR level language learner:
Some people think sugar makes you sick, but doctors disagree. 
I replaced ""eating too much sugar"" with ""sugar makes you sick"", which conveys the same idea in a simpler way. I also replaced ""causes diabetes"" with ""makes you sick"", which is more accessible to an A1 learner. Additionally, I changed ""think that is not true"" to ""disagree"", which is a more common and straightforward way to express disagreement. 
The simplified sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, but in a way that's easier for an A1 learner to understand. 
Note: A1 CEFR level language learners may not know what diabetes is, so it's better to use ""sick"" instead of ""diabetes"".

Simplified sentence: Intermediate language learner Can read easy texts about things they like with a good understanding.

Note: The word ""B1"" refers to a specific level of language proficiency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). It is not a word that can be replaced with a synonym.

However, we can replace ""straightforward factual texts"" with ""easy texts"", ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" with ""good understanding"", and ""subjects related to their field of interest"" with ""things they like"".

I don't think I can visit my grandparents in the countryside because it's difficult to get there by car because there aren't any good roads and also the weather is often bad.
The simplified version of the sentence could be: 
I don't think I can visit my grandparents in the countryside because it's hard to drive there.
Or
I don't think I can visit my grandparents in the countryside because the roads are not good and it's often rainy.

In the above example, the complex sentence was rewritten in two different ways to accommodate A1 CEFR level language learners. The first simplified sentence deletes unimportant information about the weather while the second one compresses the complex sentence to focus on the main reason. Both versions are grammatically correct, fluent, and retain the original meaning. The choice of which simplified sentence to use depends on the context and the needs of the learner. 

Here are some suggestions for further simplification for A1 CEFR level language learners:

Original sentence:
The lack of a clear and concise definition of a sustainable community has led to confusion among residents, local authorities, and stakeholders, and has hindered the development of such communities, which are considered essential for achieving the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, particularly Goal 7, which aims to ensure environmental sustainability, reduce poverty, and promote economic growth.

Simplified sentence:
There is no clear definition of a sustainable community. This makes it hard for people to know what it means. It also stops the development of these communities. They are important for helping the world become more environmentally friendly and reducing poverty.

Note: The original sentence contains several complex elements that are difficult for A1 level language learners to understand, including abstract concepts like ""Millennium Development Goals"", ""environmental sustainability"", and ""economic growth"". To simplify the sentence, I replaced these complex elements with simpler phrases, such as ""helping the world become more environmentally friendly"" and ""reducing poverty"". I also deleted some of the less important information, such as the reference to the United Nations, to make the sentence more concise. Finally, I split the long complex sentence into several shorter sentences to make it easier to follow. The resulting simplified sentence still conveys the main idea",2,3,3

Simplified:Many people here get free or cheap housing from the government. This helps them because they can't afford to buy a house.

Rewritten sentence:
Many people here get free or cheap housing from the government. This helps them because they can't afford to buy a house.

This sentence maintains the core idea of the original text while removing unnecessary information and using simpler vocabulary. The result is a clear and concise message suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners. 

The original sentence is still grammatically correct, but it contains a few complex elements that might make it difficult for A2 learners to understand. The first part of the sentence, ""In this country, many people live in areas,"" could be confusing because it starts with a phrase that doesn't directly connect to the rest of the sentence. The use of the word ""afford"" might also be challenging for some learners, as it's a verb that requires some knowledge of English","Some languages don't have some sounds that we have.

The original complex sentence is:

The rewritten sentence still conveys the same information as the original one but uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it more accessible to A1 level language learners. It also retains the main ideas of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 
Note that the original sentence contains several complex features such as:
* Two clauses joined by ""but"" which requires a higher level of reading proficiency
* Vocabulary like ""economic crisis"", ""widespread poverty"", ""unemployment"", ""affected"", ""giving"", which may be unfamiliar to A1 learners
* Long sentence structure which may be difficult to follow for non-native speakers.

The rewritten sentence addresses these issues by:
* Using shorter and more straightforward sentences
* Replacing complex vocabulary with simpler synonyms (e.g. ""economy was bad"" instead",2,3,4

The original sentence contains the following features that make it complex for A2 level language learners:
- There are two subordinate clauses (because I was worried about my health, after having eaten a bad meal at a restaurant last night) which may confuse learners.
- The word ""worried"" is not a common word for A2 level learners.
- The word ""health"" may be unfamiliar to some learners.
- The phrase ""bad meal"" could be replaced with a more common expression like ""something bad"".

By applying the simplification techniques mentioned above, we can rewrite the original sentence as follows:

I went to the doctor yesterday because I felt sick after eating something bad.

This revised sentence is easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners because:
- It has fewer subordinate clauses and uses simpler language.
- The word ""worried"" is replaced with ""felt sick"", which is a more common expression for A2 level learners.
- The word ""health"" is avoided, and instead,","Some lawyers think universities don't like new ideas.

Here is the rewritten sentence:
A little boy was taken by his mom's friend in 2009. He stayed with him for 18 months. Then the police came and brought him home in 2010. 

The simplified sentence still conveys the main idea that a young boy was kidnapped and held captive for a period of time before being rescued by the police. I made some adjustments to make it more accessible to an A1 CEFR level language learner, such as:
- Replacing ""kidnapped"" with ""taken"" to use a simpler verb
- Using ""mom's friend"" instead of ""mother's boyfriend"" to make the relationship clearer
- Breaking down the sentence into three shorter sentences to make it easier to follow
- Using more concrete language, such as ""stayed with him"" and ""brought him home"", to help learners visualize the situation.

Simplified sentence: The city council decided to take down old houses outside the town. They will sell the land to people who want to build new houses there. 

Note: I have removed the word ""abandoned"" because it is not essential to understanding the sentence, and replaced ""outskirts"" with ""outside the town"", which is a more common expression. I have also used simpler vocabulary such as ""take down"" instead of ""remove"", and ""people who want to build new houses"" instead of ""private developers"". 
Note: This sentence has been simplified by removing unimportant information (the process of selling the land) and splitting it into two simpler sentences. The main idea of the original sentence is still retained.

The final answer is Some areas had violent thunderstorms. Other areas were nice and sunny. School officials are looking for help from another country. # Step 2 : Determine the appropriate level of vocabulary for B1 CEFR level language learners

B1 level language learners should be able to understand straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest. To simplify the sentence, we can replace complex words with simpler synonyms. For example, ""violent thunderstorms"" can become ""bad weather"" or ""heavy storms"", and ""beautiful weather"" can become ""nice and sunny"".

# Step 3 : Simplify the sentence structure if necessary

The original sentence is a complex sentence with two clauses (""there were violent thunderstorms"" and ""other areas experienced beautiful weather""). We can split this into two separate simple sentences, each with its own subject and verb. This will make the sentence easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners.

# Step 4 : Check the grammar and fluency of the simplified sentence

The simplified sentence should be grammatically correct and fluent. In this case, the two simple sentences (""Some areas had violent thunderstorms"" and ""Other areas were nice and sunny"") meet these criteria.

The famous Japanese company, Sony, has announced that it will stop making CDs in 2025. This decision is because the demand for CDs has been falling rapidly over the past few years. In fact, many people have stopped buying CDs because they prefer to stream music online or download it from the internet. As a result, the sale of CDs has been decreasing sharply. However, Sony will still produce DVDs and Blu-ray discs, which are more popular than CDs. Furthermore, the company plans to increase its production of headphones and other audio products, which are very profitable. Sony hopes that these new products will help to offset the decline in CD sales. Meanwhile, many music fans are worried that this decision could lead to the end of physical music formats altogether. They fear that if CDs disappear, we might lose access to our favourite songs forever.

The main idea of the sentence is that it's safe to share the report now.

## Step 2: Determine what makes the sentence complex
The sentence is complex because it contains a subordinate clause (""but it's safe to release it now"") that adds additional information to the main clause (""This report is very detailed"").

## Step 3: Simplify the sentence by removing unnecessary words and rephrasing
To simplify the sentence, we can remove the word ""very"" from ""very detailed"" as it's not crucial to understanding the sentence. We also don't need the word ""but"" as it's a conjunction that connects two clauses, and the main idea is that it's safe to share the report.

A significant number of people are currently involved in a highly publicized debate regarding the ethics of using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture.

Original sentence:
The Greek philosopher Aristotle was born in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece, in 384 BC. He was the son of Nicomachus, a physician who served as the personal doctor to King Amyntas III of Macedon. His mother, Phaestis, was from a noble family. When Aristotle was just a baby, his father died, and he was raised by his mother's relatives in Athens. This was a common practice in ancient Greece, where children often lived with their relatives if their parents were not present. Aristotle spent most of his childhood in Athens, studying philosophy and learning from various teachers, including Plato. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he tutored the young prince Alexander, who would eventually become King Alexander III of Macedon. As a result of this tutoring, Aristotle became a close friend of Alexander's family and a member of the royal court. In 342 BC, he returned to Athens, where he founded the Lyceum, a famous school of philosophy. There, he taught many students, including Theophrastus, who later succeeded him as the head of the school. Aristotle's teachings focused on logic, ethics,","There were animals before the dinosaurs.
