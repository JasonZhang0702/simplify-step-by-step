And here is the rewritten sentence:
The 2016 US election affected many Americans, and we can still see its effects today, especially in small towns where people disagree strongly between Democrats and Republicans.

Note that I've tried to keep the rewritten sentence as close as possible to the original one in terms of content and meaning, while making it easier to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. Here are the changes I made:

*   Replaced the word ""impact"" with ""affected"", which is a simpler synonym.
*   Removed the phrase ""which is still felt today"", as it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence. Instead, I used the phrase ""and we can still see its effects today"" to convey the same idea in a simpler way.
*   Changed ""rural areas"" to ""small towns"", as it's a more accessible term for A1 CEFR level language learners.

You can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to your field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Here is a rewritten version of the sentence at the B1 CEFR level:
You can understand simple texts about things you like with some difficulty. 

In this rewritten version, I replaced the word ""straightforward"" with ""simple"", which is a synonym that is easier to understand. I also changed ""factual texts"" to ""simple texts"", and ""a satisfactory level of comprehension"" to ""some difficulty"", which conveys the same idea in a more accessible way. Additionally, I rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to follow. The resulting sentence retains the main idea of the original but is written in simpler language that is more suitable for B1 CEFR level language learners. 
Note: CEFR stands for Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. It's a framework used to describe language proficiency levels. B1 is an intermediate level where learners can understand straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest.

Simplified sentence: 'A study found that lonely people feel stressed and anxious because they find it hard to make friends and keep them.' 
(Note: the simplified sentence still conveys the same idea as the original sentence but uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences.) 

Explanation: The original sentence contains complex vocabulary such as 'Journal of Clinical Psychology', 'forming and maintaining meaningful relationships', which may be difficult for A2 level learners to understand. By using simpler synonyms like 'study' instead of 'Journal of Clinical Psychology', and 'make friends and keep them' instead of 'forming and maintaining meaningful relationships', the sentence becomes more accessible to A2 level learners. Additionally, breaking down the original sentence into two shorter sentences makes it easier to follow.

Explanation:
- Simplified the sentence structure to make it easier to understand.

Simplified sentence: My brother got sick from eating bad food at a restaurant last night. We found out after he visited the doctor. 

Note: This is a simplified version of the original sentence. It still conveys the same information but uses shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary. The main idea is that the speaker's brother got food poisoning from eating spoiled food at a restaurant and they found out after he visited the doctor. The sentence structure is also more straightforward and easy to follow.  I rewrote the sentence in order to make it easier to understand by A2 CEFR level language learners. I replaced complex words with simpler synonyms, deleted unimportant information, and split a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.

In this example, the original sentence uses the following complex elements that are simplified:
- ""straightforward"" is replaced with ""simple""
- ""factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest"" is replaced with ""simple factual texts""
- ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" is replaced with ""and understand them well"" (the word ""satisfactory"" is not necessary as it's implied that they understand them well)
- ""Can read"" is kept as it's a basic verb form that is easy to understand
- ""B1 level language learner"" is kept as it's a clear subject. 

The final simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. The simplified sentence is also easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners.

Note that there are many possible ways to simplify a sentence, and the best way will depend on the specific context and the needs of the learners. The goal is to make the sentence clear and easy to understand while still retaining the main ideas and meaning of the original. In this case, the first simplified sentence uses more everyday language and is likely to be more accessible to A2 level learners, while the second simplified sentence uses slightly more formal","He lost his godfather who was a magician.

The original sentence is:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Here is the rewritten sentence at B1 CEFR level:
Someone at B1 level can read simple facts about their favourite topics and understand them well enough.

Note: The CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is a widely used framework for describing language ability. It divides learners into six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. Each level has its own set of descriptors that describe what a learner can do at that level. The B1 level is an intermediate level, where learners can understand straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension. The rewritten sentence aims to simplify the original sentence to make it accessible to B1 level language learners. 

In this case, I replaced the complex phrase ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" with the simpler phrase ""can read simple facts"", which still","Thinking about things that can't happen will worry you.

Original Sentence:
The company has been facing difficulties in getting approval from the authorities for the construction of their new factory because the environmental impact assessment is still pending, which has led to a significant delay in the project's completion and increased the costs substantially.

Simplified Sentence:
The company is having trouble getting permission to build a new factory. They need to prove that it won't harm the environment. This is taking a lot of time and making the project more expensive.
```
The company is having trouble getting permission to build a new factory.
They need to prove that it won’t harm the environment.
This is taking a lot of time and making the project more expensive.
``` 

In this rewritten version, I have broken down the original sentence into three simpler sentences. Each sentence is clear and easy to understand, and they convey the same main ideas as the original sentence. I have also replaced some of the complex vocabulary with simpler synonyms, such as ""difficulties"" instead of ""facing"", ""permission"" instead of ""approval"", and ""harm the environment"" instead of ""environmental impact assessment"". Additionally, I have avoided using passive voice and instead used active voice to make the text more engaging and easier to follow","Don't think about bad things that can't happen.

Here is the complex sentence that I need help rewriting:

Complex:You should consider the possibility that there may be some people who will not agree with your opinion and that their disagreement may be due to a lack of understanding of the subject matter, rather than a deliberate attempt to be disagreeable.

Here is my attempt at rewriting the sentence:
Simple:Some people might not agree with you because they don't understand what you're saying.

However, I'd like to know if there are other ways to simplify the sentence further or if my version is clear enough for an A1 CEFR level language learner.

## Step 1: Identify the main idea
The main idea of the complex sentence is that some people might disagree with your opinion, but it's not necessarily because they're trying to be difficult, but rather because they don't understand the topic.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""Consider the possibility"" can be replaced with """,0.39870167,0.6098778,0.72351295,0.30135512,0.57587916,0.70628536,0.4507201313972473,0.5679627060890198,0.7689212560653687,0.3551982939243316,0.8735911846160889,0.7204490303993225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511198431253433,0.8047735095024109,0.6652436256408691,-0.6300878524780273,0.2383530139923095,0.0959556102752685,1,1,1,2,2,3

Here is the original complex sentence:

B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

And here is the rewritten simplified version:

B1 learners can understand simple texts about their favourite topics quite well.

Simplification techniques used:
- Replaced complex word 'factual' with a simpler synonym 'simple'.
- Replaced complex phrase 'straightforward' with a simpler synonym 'simple'.
- Replaced complex phrase 'satisfactory level of comprehension' with a simpler synonym 'quite well'.
- Changed the original sentence structure from a complex one to a simpler one by using a shorter sentence. 

This revised sentence conveys the same idea as the original one but is easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Original sentence: The hospital has been told to investigate whether the doctors have been making mistakes in their diagnoses and treatments because there have been some complaints about the care given to patients.

Simplified sentence: The hospital has been asked to look into complaints about doctors’ mistakes.

Breakdown of simplification:
1. Original sentence contains a complex structure with a subordinate clause (because there have been some complaints about the care given to patients) and an infinitive phrase (to investigate whether the doctors have been making mistakes in their diagnoses and treatments). 
2. Replace the complex infinitive phrase with a simpler one (look into complaints).
3. Delete the subordinate clause as it’s not essential to the main idea of the sentence.
4. Keep the main idea of the sentence intact (the hospital has been asked to do something). 

Note: This is a great opportunity to teach A2 CEFR level language learners about the importance of clear","Some people thought she was the missing daughter of the Czar, but she was not who they thought.

Original sentence:
The children had to wait outside for twenty minutes because their teacher had locked the classroom door when she left and then she forgot her keys inside.

Simplified sentence:
The children had to wait outside for twenty minutes. Their teacher had locked the classroom door and forgotten her keys inside.

Note that the original sentence was already relatively clear and straightforward, but it still contained some elements that might confuse an A1 level learner, such as the use of ""when she left"" which implies a specific reason for the action (her leaving) and the use of ""and then"" which implies a sequence of actions. To simplify the sentence, I deleted these elements and kept only the essential information, which is that the children had to wait outside for twenty minutes because their teacher locked the door and forgot her keys inside.

Simplified sentence:
The children waited outside for twenty minutes. Their teacher locked the classroom door and forgot her keys.

Complex:Although the exact date of the introduction of the first domesticated horses is unknown, archaeological evidence suggests that horses were domesticated between 4000 and 3500 BC, which is consistent with the period when humans first began to use horses for transportation.
Here's the simplified version:
Simple:Horses were first domesticated around 4000-3500 BC. This is when people started using them for transport. We don't know exactly when this happened.
The simplified sentence has been rewritten by:
* Replacing the complex word ""archaeological"" with the simpler synonym ""evidence""
* Deleting the phrase ""which is consistent with the period when"" as it is not essential to the main idea
* Splitting the sentence into two simpler sentences
* Using more basic vocabulary such as ""around"" instead of ""between""

Original sentence: The Department of Transportation’s plan to build a new highway was met with opposition from local residents, who expressed concerns about noise pollution, increased traffic, and loss of natural habitats, which would result in the destruction of several homes and businesses, leading to significant economic losses and displacement of families, who had lived in the area for generations.

Simplified sentence: The government wants to build a new road. Some people in the area don’t want this because they think it will be noisy, there will be more traffic, and it will hurt the environment. If they build the road, some houses and shops will be destroyed. This could cause problems for the people who live there and affect their jobs. They have lived there for a long time. 
Note: The original sentence contains 49 words while the simplified one contains 46 words.

Now, let’s try to simplify the following sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:

The new student in our class is from Spain and his name is Carlos. He is 16 years old. He lives with his parents and his little sister in a house near the school. He likes playing football and listening to music. He is very happy to be here in our country.

I tried to remove all the unnecessary information such as the details about his family members and the exact location of the house, which might confuse the A1 level language learners.

Therefore, the simplified sentence aims to","Some old computers used the first item on the list as the main thing.

Here is the original complex sentence:

Note: The original sentence uses a number of complex vocabulary items such as ""straightforward"", ""factual"", ""satisfactory"", ""level of comprehension"", which may be difficult for B1 level language learners to understand. The simplified sentence replaces these words with simpler alternatives such as ""simple"", ""understand them well enough"". The original sentence also uses a complex structure with two clauses joined by ""with"", which may be hard for B1 level learners to follow. The simplified sentence splits this into two separate clauses, making it easier to understand. 
The main ideas of the original sentence are retained in the simplified sentence, but the language is made easier to understand for B1 level language learners.

Original sentence: The teacher had been teaching English to students in the school for ten years and had become very good at it.

The simplified sentence is more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners because it contains fewer words and is easier to understand. However, it still retains the main idea of the original sentence. The use of ""has taught"" instead of ""had been teaching"" is a good example of how to simplify a sentence without losing its meaning. Additionally, the word ""now"" is used to indicate that the teacher is still good at teaching English, which makes the sentence more understandable for A1 CEFR level language learners.

The original sentence is already quite clear and straightforward, but I've made some minor adjustments to make it even more accessible to B1 level language learners. Here's the breakdown:

* ""Straightforward"" is a good word, but it might not be familiar to all B1 learners. I replaced it with ""simple"", which is a more common adjective.

Simplified: Some people have never seen a photo of someone they don't know. Other people have many photos of friends and family on their phones.

## Step 1: Identify the main idea of the complex sentence
The main idea of the complex sentence is the comparison between people who have never seen a picture of someone they don't know and those who have many photos of friends and family on their phones.

## Step 2: Determine what information is essential and what can be deleted
Information about ""some parts of the world"" and ""other places"" can be deleted because it's not crucial to the main idea. Additionally, the phrase ""on their phones"" could be removed as it's not essential to the comparison being made.

## Step 3: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
The word ""hundreds or thousands"" can be replaced with ""many"" to make it simpler.

Original: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension. Simplified: B1 level learners can understand straightforward texts about things they're interested in.
The original sentence is quite long and includes some complex vocabulary. Here's a breakdown of how I simplified it:
- ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" became ""can understand straightforward texts"". This change makes the sentence more concise and uses a more common verb (""understand"") instead of the less common ""read"".
- ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" became ""about things they're interested in"". This change uses more everyday language and makes the sentence easier to understand.
- ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" became nothing, as it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence. The sentence still conveys the same idea without it. The resulting simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of the original sentence without altering its meaning. Let me know if you'd like any further assistance! I'm here to help.

I also deleted the phrase ""a majority vote of the council members"" as it is not essential to understanding the main idea of the sentence. The simplified sentence retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 

The original sentence is:
Although the mayor was not present at the council meeting, the city's new traffic plan was discussed and approved, despite some residents' strong objections, by a majority vote of the council members.

The unique and distinctive features of each individual's voice, such as tone, pitch, and volume, allow us to recognize and identify different voices.
Original sentence with some minor changes to facilitate the simplification process:We can recognize different voices because of their unique characteristics, like tone, pitch, and volume.

Simplified sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:We can tell people apart by their voices. This is because every voice sounds different.

Note: The original sentence contains complex vocabulary (e.g., ""distinctive features,"" ""recognize and identify"") and grammar (e.g., passive voice). The simplified sentence uses more basic vocabulary (e.g., ""tell people apart"") and grammar (e.g., active voice) to convey the same idea in a clearer and more accessible way. The main ideas of the original sentence remain intact, but the language is adjusted to suit the A2 CEFR level. I rewrote the sentence to make it more understandable for A2 level language learners by:

Here's my attempt at rewriting the complex sentence in a simpler way for B1 CEFR level language learners:
Students who have a B1 level can read simple texts about things they're interested in and understand them fairly well.

I replaced the word ""factual"" with ""simple"", which is a more accessible synonym for B1 learners. I also deleted the phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"", which might be too complicated for B1 learners. Finally, I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more natural-sounding. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything! 

Here are some additional suggestions for further simplification:

*   ""straightforward factual texts"" could become ""easy-to-read texts""
*   ""subjects related to their field of interest"" could become ""things they like learning about""
*   ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" could become ""understand them fairly well""

These changes would result in an even simpler sentence:

Here is the original complex sentence: The world's biggest nuclear power plants are located in France, the United States, and Japan. These plants produce more than 10% of the electricity used in each country. They also create radioactive waste that remains dangerous for thousands of years. 

And here is the rewritten simplified sentence: Nuclear power plants are big in France, America, and Japan. They give a lot of the countries' electricity. But they also make bad waste that stays harmful for a very long time. 

I have followed the guidelines above and rewritten the text in a way that is clear and easy to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners. Here are my justifications for each change:

1. Simplified vocabulary: I replaced ""nuclear"" with ""big"", ""power plants"" with ""plants"", and ""electricity"" with ""the countries' electricity"". This makes the text more accessible to A2 learners who may not be familiar with these technical terms.

2. Compression: I removed the phrase ""the world's biggest"" as it's not crucial to the understanding of the text. The focus is on the location of the plants, not their size.

3. Splitting complex sentences: I","Some shops sell many types of bullets for one type of gun.

Original Sentence:
""The doctors and nurses are working very hard today because they have to take care of a lot of patients who are very sick and need special treatment, and some of them have to go to the hospital.""

Simplified Sentence:
""The doctors and nurses are working hard today. They have to take care of many sick people who need help.""

Note that the simplified sentence uses shorter sentences and more basic vocabulary, but still conveys the main idea of the original sentence. Here are the changes made:
- ""very hard"" was changed to ""hard"" to reduce complexity
- ""a lot of"" was changed to ""many"" to simplify the language
- ""who are very sick"" was changed to ""who are sick"" to remove unnecessary adverbs
- ""and need special treatment"" was removed to reduce the sentence length and focus on the main idea
- ""and some of them have to go to the hospital"" was removed to avoid adding too much extra information
- The sentence structure was changed to use shorter, simpler sentences (""The doctors and nurses are working hard today."" and ""They have to take care of many sick people who need help."")

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""paying its employees too much money"" can be simplified to ""paying its employees too much"".
- ""reduce their salaries"" can remain as it is, but ""reduce"" is a common enough word that A2 learners should be familiar with.
- ""losing a lot of money"" can be simplified to ""not making enough money"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
The time frame ""for years"" is not crucial to understanding the sentence's main idea.

Original sentence: 
The teacher was worried about the student who had forgotten his school bag at home and had to come back for it before the lesson started.

Simplified sentence: 
The teacher was worried because a student forgot his school bag and had to go back for it.

Explanation:
- The word ""worried"" is a complex adjective that may be difficult for A1 learners to understand. It's replaced with the verb ""was worried"", which is more common and straightforward.
- The phrase ""who had forgotten his school bag at home"" is a subordinate clause that might be hard for A1 learners to follow. It's simplified to ""forgot his school bag"" and then rephrased to ""had to go back for it"", which conveys the same idea in a more straightforward way. 
- The preposition ""before the lesson started"" is deleted because it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence, and A1 learners may struggle with complex prepositions. 

Note: This explanation is based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) levels, which is a widely used framework for describing language proficiency.

Original sentence: The two main concerns of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are to ensure food security and to protect the environment. The CAP aims to provide farmers with financial support, training and technical assistance to help them produce food efficiently and sustainably. Furthermore, the CAP also helps to reduce poverty and inequality among farmers in rural areas.

Therefore, there is a need to find a balance between economic growth and environmental protection.

Simplified sentence: The European Union wants to make sure we have enough food and that the Earth is protected. They help farmers by giving them money and teaching them new things.

Original sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence:
B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts and understand them well.

Explanation:
- The original sentence uses the phrase ""straightforward factual texts"" which might be difficult for B1 learners to understand. Replacing this phrase with ""simple factual texts"" makes the sentence clearer.
- The word ""satisfactory"" is replaced with ""well"", which is easier to understand.
- The whole sentence is split into two shorter sentences for better clarity. 
- The original sentence uses a passive construction (""Can read...with a satisfactory level of comprehension""), which is replaced with an active construction (""can read...and understand"") for better fluency. 

Note: The simplified sentence should not change the meaning of the original sentence. The main idea remains the same:","Learning about the Ediacara biota is very important.

Here's the breakdown of how I simplified the sentence:
- 'The government of Japan' is equivalent to 'The Japanese government'. 
- 'will make a decision' is equivalent to 'will decide'. 
- 'on whether to buy a new fighter jet in 2020 or not' is equivalent to 'if they want to buy a new fighter jet in 2020'. 
- 'according to the country's defence minister' is deleted as it provides additional information that is not crucial to understanding the main idea of the sentence. 

The simplified sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. It is now suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners.

Original Sentence: Although the school has been in existence for more than fifty years, its history is not well documented, and much of what is known about the school's past comes from oral tradition, which is often unreliable, especially when compared to written records. Therefore, many of the events that have taken place at the school over the years are unclear or disputed.
Simplified Sentence: The school has been here for over 50 years, but we don't know much about its past. We only know some things because people tell stories about it. These stories are not always true, especially when compared to written records. So, many things that have happened here are unclear or disputed.

Here is a rewritten version of the sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners: The city council wants to spend more money on buses and trains.

Note: I have deleted the word ""increase"" because it is a complex word, and instead used the word ""spend more"".

Finally, I have changed the phrase ""public transportation, including buses and trains"" to simply ""buses and trains"", as this is easier to understand for A1 level language learners.

Explanation:
- The original sentence contains complex vocabulary (e.g., ""researcher"", ""in charge"", ""urgent"", ""attend"", ""travel"") and a long subordinate clause that describes why the person couldn't attend the meeting.
- In the simplified sentence, I replaced the complex words with simpler synonyms (e.g., ""person"" instead of ""researcher"", ""stay"" instead of ""attend"", ""go"" instead of ""travel"").
- I also deleted the unnecessary word ""late"" in the phrase ""late 10th century"".
- Finally, I split the original sentence into two simpler sentences to make it easier to understand. The main idea of the original sentence is preserved, but the language is much simpler and more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners.

Original sentence:
The researchers found that most of the participants in the study had previously been exposed to English as a foreign language and had acquired some basic knowledge of it.

Simplified sentence: After the festival, the artist will go back to her studio and start working on her next big project. It will look at how nature and technology are connected.

The original sentence is too difficult for A2 CEFR level language learners because it contains:
- complex vocabulary: 'large-scale', 'installation', 'explores', 'relationship'
- complex sentence structure: relative clause ('which is a large-scale installation...')
- some unimportant information: 'After the festival...', 'her next project' (it is not essential to mention these details)

The simplified sentence retains the main ideas of the original sentence but uses simpler vocabulary and sentence structure. It also omits unnecessary information to make it easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners.

The project's objective is to increase the number of tourists visiting the city, which will contribute to the local economy, but it is expected that the new construction projects will also cause problems such as increased traffic congestion, noise pollution, and damage to historic buildings, and it is not clear if the benefits of tourism outweigh the negative impacts of the new developments.

Simplified sentence:
The goal of this project is to attract more visitors to the city. This will help the local economy. However, the new buildings may cause some problems, like more traffic jams and noise. We don't know if the good things about tourism are more important than the bad things about the new buildings. 
(Additional simplification could include rephrasing the sentence in the present tense, e.g. ""The goal of this project is to attract more visitors to the city now..."") 

Note: The original sentence contains a few complex structures, including a subordinate clause introduced by ""which"" (which indicates a consequence), a conditional sentence (""it is expected""), and an uncertain condition (""and it is not clear""). To simplify these, we need to break them down into shorter","It was raining in the north-east.

Here's a rewritten version of the sentence at the B1 level:

B1 level learners can understand simple factual texts about things they like with some difficulty.

Here's how I simplified the sentence:

* I replaced ""straightforward factual texts"" with ""simple factual texts"", which uses a more accessible vocabulary.
* I changed ""subjects related to their field of interest"" to ""things they like"", which uses a more natural and familiar expression.

The old man walked quickly through the crowded streets because he wanted to catch the last bus before it left the station.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The key elements of the sentence include the main action (the old man walked), the reason for the action (he wanted to catch the last bus), and the context (crowded streets and the bus leaving the station).

## Step 2: Simplify the vocabulary
Replace complex words with simpler synonyms. For example, ""crowded"" can be replaced with ""busy"", ""quickly"" can be replaced with ""fast"", and ""because"" can be replaced with ""so"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
Remove any unnecessary details that don't affect the main idea of the sentence. In this case, we can remove the phrase ""before it left the station"" as it's not crucial to understanding the main action.

## Step 4: Split the sentence into simpler ones
Break down the sentence into two or more shorter sentences that",0.30821905,0.25862023,0.404402,0.16547473,0.1380374,0.23362857,0.3624399602413177,0.3781521320343017,0.5121221542358398,0.1379940211772918,0.2678992748260498,0.1232046484947204,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0748914405703544,-0.0273193083703517,0.3849377632141113,1.1107988357543943,1.0744667053222656,0.6181416511535645,1,1,1,2,2,3

Here is the original sentence:
You can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to your field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified version for B1 CEFR level language learners:
You can read simple texts about things you are interested in and understand them well enough.

Explanation:
The original sentence contains complex vocabulary such as ""straightforward"", ""factual"", and ""satisfactory"". These words have been replaced with simpler synonyms like ""simple"" and ""well enough"".
Additionally, the sentence has been compressed by removing unnecessary words such as ""on subjects related to your field of interest"" which can be understood from the context.
Lastly, the sentence has been split into two simpler ones to improve clarity and fluency. The first sentence ""You can read simple texts about things you are interested in"" retains the main idea of reading texts on subjects of interest, while the second sentence ""and understand them well enough"" conveys the","Many characters in the series have special powers based on the elements.

Original Sentence: Many countries, particularly those in Asia, are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of climate change on their economies, which could lead to increased migration, decreased food production, and reduced water availability. They are also worried that rising temperatures will cause more frequent natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, which could result in significant economic losses and displacement of people. Furthermore, governments are struggling to adapt to the changing climate and find ways to mitigate its effects. 

Simplified Sentence: Some countries in Asia are worried about climate change. It could affect their economies, food, and water. This might cause people to move away and lead to big economic problems. Governments are finding it hard to deal with the changes and stop the bad effects. 

Note: The simplified sentence is not word-for-word translation but rather a rewritten version of the original sentence in simpler language. The main ideas are retained, but the sentence structure and vocabulary are adjusted to make it more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners. 

Here is another example: Original Sentence: The rise of e-commerce has led to a significant shift in consumer behavior, with many people opting for online shopping over traditional brick-and-mortar stores.","Many characters have special powers based on water, earth, fire, etc.

The government will make new rules to help the Earth. But some people are worried that these rules might also make it hard for companies to work and create jobs.

Or alternatively:

The government wants to help the Earth. But they might make it harder for businesses to work and make jobs.

Note: I've used shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary to make the text more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. I've also avoided using complex phrases or idioms that may be difficult for them to understand. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to suggest alternative simplifications! 

Here are two other attempts at rewriting the sentence in a way that is easier to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners:

Here is the complex sentence that needs to be rewritten:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

The rewritten simplified sentence should be:
You can read simple texts about things you like with a good level of understanding. 

This is the breakdown of how I simplified the sentence:
- I replaced the word ""factual"" with the word ""simple"".
- I changed ""straightforward"" to ""simple"" because the word ""straightforward"" is not necessary here as the sentence already implies that the texts are easy to understand.
- I changed ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" to ""good level of understanding"". This change makes the sentence easier to understand for B1 level language learners because it uses more everyday language. 

I also kept the main ideas of the original sentence intact, such as the idea that B1 level language learners can read texts on subjects they are interested in. The resulting simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence. 

Note: The CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages","In 1961, Davitashvili said that birds use their tails to find a partner and many people agree with him.

Rewrite the following complex sentence in order to make it easier to understand by A2 CEFR level language learners:

Original complex sentence: The company's new project aims to improve the efficiency of the production process, reduce energy consumption, and decrease the environmental impact of their manufacturing activities.

Simplified version: The company wants to make their factory work better, use less energy, and not harm the environment as much.

Note: The simplified sentence still conveys the main ideas of the original sentence, but uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners. The original sentence has been compressed and paraphrased to reduce its complexity. 

The final answer is: The company wants to make their factory work better, use less energy, and not harm the environment as much. 
Note: This is just one possible simplification of the original sentence. There may be other ways to simplify it while still retaining the main ideas. 
If you want to improve your writing","Some people think birds use their tails to find friends.

Here is the original sentence:

Here is the rewritten simplified sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:
""The big city is not a good place to live because it is noisy and dirty, and there is a lot of crime.""

The rewritten sentence uses simpler vocabulary (e.g., ""noisy"" instead of ""noise"", ""dirty"" instead of ""pollution"") and shorter sentences (e.g., ""it is noisy"" instead of ""there was a lot of noise""). It also omits some of the original information (e.g., ""many dangers"" is reduced to ""a lot of crime""), but still conveys the main idea of the original sentence. The resulting sentence is grammatical, fluent, and easy to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. The answer is: The big city is not a good place to live because it is noisy and dirty, and there is a lot of crime. (2019)## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the original sentence

Or alternatively:

Note: These simplified sentences are intended to convey the same information as the original sentence, but in a way that is easier for A2 CEFR level language learners to understand. The key is to avoid using complex vocabulary, grammar, or sentence structures that may be difficult for learners at this level to comprehend.

However , the researchers said that this is not because being overweight causes people to be less active and eat more calories . Instead , it is likely that being overweight is a result of people being less active and eating more calories .

Complex:B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension, but they may find some difficult vocabulary and grammar structures that need more explanation and practice.

In this example, the original sentence contains a few complex elements that could be simplified:
- The phrase ""straightforward factual texts"" could be replaced with the simpler ""simple texts"".
- The word ""satisfactory"" could be replaced with the simpler ""most"".
- The phrase ""related to their field of interest"" could be deleted as it's not crucial to understanding the main idea.

*   ""Workstations"" was replaced with ""desks"" because ""workstations"" might be too technical for A1 learners.
*   ""Familiarize themselves with their equipment"" was changed to ""learn about their machines"" because ""familiarize themselves"" is a more complicated phrase that A1 learners may not understand.

Original sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Simplified sentence:
B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts and understand them well.

Explanation:
The original sentence contains two complex elements:
1. ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" - This part of the sentence uses the word ""straightforward"", which is a relatively advanced vocabulary for B1 level learners. A simpler synonym for this word is ""simple"".
2. ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" - This part of the sentence uses the phrase ""satisfactory level of comprehension"", which is a bit too formal and abstract for B1 level learners. A simpler way to express this idea is to use the phrase ""and understand them well"".

By making these changes, the sentence becomes more accessible to B1","There are also more complicated solutions for the cubic equation and the quartic equation.

The new policy aims to improve the quality of the water in the polluted rivers of our country by reducing the amount of industrial waste dumped into them.

Here is the simplified version of the sentence:
The new policy wants to clean the dirty rivers in our country by throwing away less factory waste.

The new policy aims to improve the quality of the water in the polluted rivers of our country by reducing the amount of industrial waste dumped into them.
This sentence is too complex for A2 CEFR level language learners. Here's a breakdown of why:
- The sentence contains a lot of vocabulary that may not be familiar to A2 learners, such as ""policy"", ""quality"", ""industrial waste"", and ""dumped"".
- The sentence structure is also complex, with multiple clauses and phrases that may be difficult for A2 learners to follow.
- The sentence requires a certain level of prior knowledge and understanding of environmental issues and government policies.

The simplified sentence:
The new policy wants to clean the dirty rivers in our country by throwing away less factory waste.

- It uses simpler vocabulary, such","People disagree about why there's a hotspot.

Original sentence: 
The Ministry of Education and Research (MoE) has been criticized for not providing enough support to students who have special needs, including those who require accommodations for learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and autism. 
Simplified sentence:
The Ministry of Education is being criticized for not helping students with special needs. 

In the simplified sentence, I deleted the following information: 
* ""and Research"" 
* ""including those who require accommodations""
* ""such as dyslexia and autism""

I also replaced the following complex word with a simpler synonym: 
* ""criticized"" -> ""helping"" (is not exactly a synonym but in this context, it is close enough)

Note that the simplified sentence still conveys the main idea of the original one: the Ministry of Education is not doing enough to help students with special needs.  The original sentence is complex because it contains a lot of specific details, such as the name of the ministry, the type of disabilities, etc. These details are not necessary to convey the main idea, which is why they were removed in the simplified sentence. 

In this case, I would recommend splitting the simplified sentence into two simpler sentences:

Original sentence:
The English language is often misunderstood as being more difficult than other languages because of its irregularities, such as its unpredictable pronunciation and spelling, but actually, this is not the case; English is one of the easiest languages to learn and use, especially for people who already know another language. In fact, many English speakers have never learned grammar rules or studied vocabulary lists; they simply pick up the language through everyday conversation and listening to native speakers. This is possible because of the language's simplicity and flexibility, which allows learners to communicate effectively even with a limited vocabulary. For example, if you only know 1,000 words, you can still express yourself clearly and accurately in everyday situations. Moreover, the language has a high degree of tolerance for mistakes, which means that non-native speakers can speak English without fear of making errors. As a result, many people around the world are able to communicate in English despite not having perfect grammar or vocabulary.

Simplified sentence:

Here's an example of a complex sentence that requires simplification for B1 CEFR level language learners:

B1 CEFR level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Can you simplify this sentence to make it easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners? 

The final answer is: 
B1 CEFR level learners can easily read simple texts about things they're interested in. 

Explanation: 
This sentence has been simplified by replacing the complex word ""straightforward"" with a simpler synonym ""simple"", and also by changing ""related to their field of interest"" to ""things they're interested in"" which is a more natural and easier way to express this idea. Additionally, the phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" has been removed as it is not essential to the main idea of the sentence and can be inferred from the context.","Inside the robot, there was a chessboard. It helped control the robot's arm.

Original Sentence:In this context, it is essential to consider the notion of an 'ideal' audience, which refers to a group of people who are assumed to possess a certain level of knowledge or understanding about a particular topic. However, in reality, the actual audience may not have the same level of knowledge or experience as the ideal audience. This discrepancy can lead to difficulties in communicating effectively with the actual audience, which may not be familiar with the specialized terminology or concepts used by the ideal audience. Furthermore, the ideal audience may assume that the actual audience is more knowledgeable than they actually are, which can result in a lack of clarity and effectiveness in communication.
Simplified Sentence:When we talk to a group of people, we often think they know something already. But sometimes, they don't. This can make it hard to explain things clearly. We might use big words or complicated ideas that the others don't understand. This can cause problems when we try to communicate with them. 
Note that the simplified sentence is shorter and uses more basic vocabulary. It still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, but in a way that is easier for A2 CEFR level language learners to","There is a chessboard inside the robot. It helps the robot move its arm.

Here's a rewritten version of the sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:

3. The word ""instead"" was replaced with ""then"" because ""then"" is a more common word used in everyday conversation, especially for A1 level learners.

The following is the complex sentence you need to simplify for B1 CEFR level language learners:
B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Here is a suggested simplified version of the sentence:
B1 learners can read simple factual texts about things they're interested in and understand them well enough.

I think the following simplifications could be made to the original sentence:

* ""B1 level language learners"" can be replaced with ""B1 learners"" to make the sentence more concise.
* ""straightforward factual texts"" can be replaced with ""simple factual texts"" to make the sentence easier to understand.
* ""subjects related to their field of interest"" can be replaced with ""things they're interested in"" to make the sentence more conversational and accessible.
* ""a satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be replaced with ""understand them well enough"" to make the sentence more idiomatic and easier to comprehend.

Here's the revised sentence:

B1 learners can read simple factual texts about","Their mom worries every time the boys are thirsty.

The original sentence is: By using a technique called 'compounding', we can produce high-quality materials with unique properties that cannot be found in nature. Furthermore, we can also produce large quantities of these materials in a relatively short period of time.
Simplified sentence:
We can make special materials with good qualities that we don't find in nature. We can also make a lot of these materials quickly.
Answer: The simplified sentence should be: We can make special materials with good qualities that we don't find in nature. We can also make a lot of these materials quickly.
The original sentence contains complex vocabulary (e.g., 'compounding', 'unique properties'), a subordinate clause ('Furthermore...'), and an adverbial phrase ('in a relatively short period of time'). 
To simplify it, I replaced the complex word 'compounding' with a simpler synonym 'make'. I deleted the subordinate clause as it was not crucial to the main idea of the sentence. I also split the long sentence into two shorter ones to make it easier to understand. The simplified sentence retains the main ideas of the original one without altering its meaning. 
This is an example of simplification for A2 CEFR level language learners, as it","Their mom worries when they are thirsty.

Original sentence: In the 1970s, the first digital computers were still quite large and very expensive, but they were also very powerful and capable of performing calculations much faster than human brains could.
Simplified sentence: In the 1970s, the first computers were big and costly, but they worked quickly and could do lots of calculations fast.

The original sentence contains complex vocabulary (e.g., ""digital"", ""expensive"", ""powerful"", ""calculations"") and a subordinate clause (""but they were also very powerful and capable of performing calculations much faster than human brains could""), which may be difficult for A2 level language learners to understand. The simplified sentence replaces these complex words and structures with simpler ones, making it easier to comprehend. Here's the step-by-step simplification process:

1. Replace ""digital"" with ""first"" to make the sentence more accessible:
Original: ""the first digital computers""
Simplified: ""the first computers","We don't know where tapeworms get their bad cells.

The original sentence is: Many scientists believe that the universe is infinite because they think that there are an infinite number of stars in the observable universe, but some scientists disagree with them and think that the universe might be finite if we can only see a finite number of stars in the observable universe.

Here is a rewritten version of the sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:

Some scientists think the universe is very big and never ends. They say this because they think there are many stars in the universe that we can see. But other scientists don't agree. They think maybe the universe is not so big and we just can't see all the stars.  OR Some scientists think the universe is very big and never ends. They see many stars in the universe. But other scientists think maybe the universe is small and we can't see all the stars. OR Many scientists think the universe is very big. They think this because there are many stars in the universe.

Here's an example of how to simplify the given complex sentence:
Original sentence: Please rewrite the following complex sentence in order to make it easier to understand by B1 CEFR level language learners. B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: We need to make this text easier to understand for people who have a basic level of English.

The simplified sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence without changing its meaning. It uses simpler vocabulary such as ""basic level"" instead of ""B1 CEFR level"", and ""straightforward factual texts"" is replaced with ""text"". Additionally, the sentence structure is broken down to make it clearer and more understandable. 
Note: CEFR stands for Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. It is a framework used to describe the language ability of learners. B1 is one of the six levels of language proficiency in the CEFR framework, indicating an intermediate level of language ability. 

I rewrote the sentence as follows:
We need to make this text easier to understand for people who have a basic level of English.

However,","It had a hand crank and was inside a wooden box.

Complex:The old house was in a poor condition, but it had been well maintained over the years.
Simple:The old house was in a bad state, but people looked after it.

Original sentence: The sudden change in the weather forecast caused the public to become confused about the possibility of a severe storm hitting the area, which led to widespread panic among the population.

Simplified sentence: A new weather forecast made people worried about a big storm coming. This caused a lot of people to get scared.

Note that the simplified sentence is shorter and uses more basic vocabulary (e.g. ""worried"" instead of ""confused"", ""scared"" instead of ""panic""), but still conveys the same main idea as the original sentence. The sentence structure has also been simplified, with a more straightforward subject-verb-object word order. The tone of the sentence has also been made more accessible, with a focus on the emotional impact of the weather forecast rather than the technical details. The original sentence contains 23 words, while the simplified sentence contains 15 words. This makes the simplified sentence easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners. 

The rewritten sentence should be:
A new weather forecast made people worried about","It had a handle and was in a wooden case.

Here's the complex sentence to be rewritten:
The police arrested the man who had stolen a car in the city centre.

Simplification steps:

1.  Replace complex words with simpler synonyms:
    *   ""police"" → ""cops""
    *   ""arrested"" → ""caught""
    *   ""man"" → ""person""
    *   ""stolen"" → ""taken""
2.  Delete unimportant information:
    *   Remove the phrase ""in the city centre"" as it's not crucial to the main idea.
3.  Split a long complex sentence into several simpler ones:
    *   Break down the sentence into two sentences: 
        - The cops caught a person.
        - The person had taken a car.

Final Simplified Sentence:
The cops caught a person. The person had taken a car.

This revised sentence is easier to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners, retaining the main ideas of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 

**Note:** Please keep in mind that simplifying a sentence may result in a loss of some nuances or details present in the original text.

Original sentence:You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence needs to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.
Simplified sentence:To make the text easier to understand, you can replace hard words with simpler ones, leave out unnecessary details, or break a long sentence into shorter ones. The rewritten text should still make sense and be easy to read. 
The final answer","Young girls like new things better than old things on TV or in movies.

The following sentence is to be rewritten for B1 level language learners:
B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Rewritten sentence: B1 level learners can easily read simple texts about things they're interested in.

Explanation: I replaced ""straightforward"" with ""simple"", ""factual"" with no change (it's a familiar word for B1 learners), ""satisfactory"" with ""easy"", and ""comprehension"" with ""read"". I also changed ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" to ""about things they're interested in"", which is a more natural way of expressing the idea. The resulting sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of the original sentence. 

Note: CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is a framework used to describe language ability. B1 is an intermediate level of language proficiency. At this level, learners can understand straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest.","They have learned how to cheat.

Simplified sentence: A 30-year-old woman was a victim of human trafficking. She was made to work as a prostitute for two years. She was kept locked in a hotel room for 18 months.

The original sentence is too long and complex for an A2 CEFR level language learner. It contains many difficult vocabulary items and grammatical structures. The simplified sentence breaks down the information into three shorter sentences that are easier to understand. Each sentence contains the main idea of the original sentence, but in a simpler way. Here are some specific changes made to simplify the text:

*   The original sentence starts with ""The 30-year-old woman"", which is a complex phrase. The simplified sentence uses the subject pronoun ""she"" to refer to the woman, making it easier to understand.
*   The original sentence contains the phrase ""identified as a victim of human trafficking"", which is a complex and formal expression. The simplified sentence uses the phrase ""was a victim of human","They know how to cheat.

Complex sentence: I was exhausted from the long flight, but my sister was excited to be on holiday and couldn’t wait to explore the new city.

Explanation: 
In this example, the word “exhausted” is replaced with “very tired” to make it easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners. Additionally, the phrase “couldn’t wait to explore the new city” is deleted because it is not essential to the main idea of the sentence, which is that the speaker was tired while their sister was excited. However, if you want to keep the main idea intact, you could simplify it further to: “I was very tired from the flight, but my sister was looking forward to the holiday.” 

Let's try another one.

The original sentence is:

Here is the rewritten text in simpler terms suitable for A2 CEFR level language learners:

I deleted the word ""meeting"" which might be a bit too formal, and changed ""will have"" to ""will talk to"", which is a more common way to express the idea. I also changed ""next Monday afternoon"" to ""on Monday afternoon"", which is a more informal way to say the same thing. Let me know if you need further changes!

Original sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Simplified sentence:
B1 level learners can understand simple factual texts about their favourite topics.

Explanation:
The original sentence is quite long and contains some complex vocabulary such as 'straightforward', 'satisfactory', and 'comprehension'. In the simplified sentence, I replaced these words with simpler synonyms like 'simple' and 'understand'. I also removed the phrase 'on subjects related to their field of interest' which is not essential to the main idea of the sentence. Finally, I reworded the sentence to make it shorter and easier to follow. The simplified sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original one, but in a more accessible way for B1 level language learners. 

Here are the steps I took to simplify the sentence:

1. Replace complex words with simpler synonyms:
	* 'straightforward' -> 'simple'
	* 'satisfactory' -> 'simple'
	* 'comprehension' -> 'understand'
2. Delete unimportant information:
	* Removed the phrase 'on","Even though I had a long weekend, I didn't finish my work because I kept putting things off.

Complex:We asked our parents where to meet them after the concert . 
Simplification: 
We asked our parents where to meet them after the show.

The original sentence is already quite clear and simple, but it still contains some unnecessary information (""the concert""). The simplified sentence retains the same meaning but omits the less important word. This simplification is more of a refinement than a drastic change, but it makes the sentence slightly easier to understand for A2 level learners. 

Complex:Jimmy eventually learned when to ask his mother for money .
Simplification: 
Jimmy learned when to ask his mother for money.

This simplification is a bit more significant. The original sentence uses the adverb ""eventually"", which indicates that Jimmy took a long time to learn when to ask for money. However, the adverb is not crucial to understanding the main idea of the sentence. By removing it, the simplified sentence still conveys the same information, but in a more straightforward way. 

Complex:Charlie Brown has a friend called Pig Pen .
Simplification: 
Charlie Brown has a friend named Pig Pen.

In this case, the simplification involves changing the","Although I had a lot of free time, I still couldn't finish my work.

Here is the original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Here is the simplified sentence: B1 level language learners can understand simple texts about their favourite subjects quite well. 

Explanation:
The original sentence is too complex because it contains:
- A phrase ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" which is a complex noun phrase
- A prepositional phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest""
- An idiomatic expression ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension""

To simplify the sentence, I replaced the complex noun phrase with a simpler one (""simple texts""), deleted the prepositional phrase (""about their favourite subjects""), and replaced the idiomatic expression with a more straightforward phrase (""quite well""). The result is a clearer and more accessible sentence for B1 CEFR level language learners. 

This rewritten sentence still conveys the same idea as the original sentence: it describes what B1 level language learners can do in terms of reading. It is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 

Note: This example is a bit tricky since the original sentence is not extremely","Thirteen trucks had over one million bullets taken out safely.

- Replaced complex words with simpler synonyms: ""rise"" -> ""many"", ""multifaceted"" -> ""big"", ""effective"" -> ""good"", ""quality"" -> ""good"", ""scarce"" -> ""few""

The original complex sentence is:

Simplification of the original complex sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:
The study found that many people had trouble understanding the new rule. But it was easy to learn how to use it.
Explanation:
- ‘research’ was replaced with ‘study’
- ‘difficulty’ was replaced with ‘trouble’
- ‘policy’ was replaced with ‘rule’
- ‘understanding’ was replaced with ‘learn’
- ‘how to use it’ was changed to ‘how to use it’ which is already simple enough for A1 level learners
- ‘but’ was kept because it is a common conjunction used in simple sentences. If you need to keep the sentence structure intact, then you can keep it. However, if you feel that it disrupts the flow of the sentence, you can remove it and use two separate sentences.
- The overall sentence structure was kept intact, with a subject-verb-object word order, making it easier for A1 level learners to follow.

Original sentence: ""The company's policy is that all employees must wear a uniform when they are working outside the office.""
Simplified sentence: ""The company says all workers must wear a uniform when they work outside the office.""  This version uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences, making it more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. 

In this case, I used the following techniques to simplify the original sentence:

* Replaced the word ""policy"" with ""says"", which is a simpler synonym.
* Changed the word ""employees"" to ""workers"", which is also a simpler synonym.
* Shortened the sentence by removing the phrase ""when they are working"".
* Made the sentence more concise by removing the phrase ""outside the office"". 
* Retained the main idea of the original sentence, which is that the company requires employees to wear a uniform when working outside the office. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Original sentence:
The task of building a national identity in post-independence Malaysia was complicated by the fact that the country had been colonized by multiple foreign powers, including Britain, Japan, and Portugal. This legacy of colonialism led to a diverse range of cultures, languages, and ethnic groups, which made it difficult to establish a unified national identity.
Simplified sentence:
Malaysia was ruled by different countries before it became independent. This made it hard to create a single Malaysian identity. There were many cultures, languages, and ethnic groups because of this. 
Note that the original sentence uses complex vocabulary such as ""complicated"", ""colonized"", ""legacy"", ""diverse"", ""unified"", and ""ethnic"". In the simplified sentence, I replaced these words with simpler synonyms like ""hard"", ""ruled"", ""many"", and ""single"". I also deleted some information about the specific countries that colonized Malaysia and focused on the main idea of the sentence, which is that Malaysia's history made it difficult to create a single national identity. The simplified sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the main ideas of the original","There are two kinds of boat charters. You can sail the boat yourself or someone else will sail it for you.

Here's the complex sentence to be rewritten for an A1 CEFR level language learner:

(or) The company manager was tired after working hard for many years, so he decided to retire and sell his house. (or) The company manager was old and tired, so he decided to retire and sell his house. 

In the above example, we replaced the complex sentence with three possible simplified versions. We replaced the complex noun phrase ""the company's manager"" with the simpler noun phrase ""the company manager"". We also replaced the complex verb phrase ""had been working hard for many years"" with the simpler verb phrase ""worked hard for many years"" or ""was tired after working hard for many years"" or ""was old and tired"". Finally, we removed the subordinate clause ""who had been working hard for many years"" and made it an independent clause.

Original sentence:
The initial reason for the invention of the first computer was not to make calculations faster or to process large amounts of data but rather to assist scientists and engineers in solving complex problems.

Simplified sentence:
The first computer was invented to help scientists and engineers solve difficult problems.

Explanation:
The original sentence is a complex one because it contains several clauses and sub-clauses, as well as abstract concepts (e.g., ""assist"", ""solve complex problems""). To simplify it, we need to focus on the main idea and eliminate unnecessary information. We can start by breaking down the sentence into two simpler ones:
1. The first computer was invented for a specific purpose.
2. That purpose was to help scientists and engineers.

Now, let's replace some of the complex words with simpler synonyms:
- ""initial"" becomes ""first""
- ""invention"" becomes ""invented""
- ""complex problems"" becomes ""difficult problems""
- ""assist"" becomes ""help""

Here's the simplified sentence:
The first computer was invented to help scientists and engineers solve difficult problems. This sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence but uses more straightforward language that's easier for A2 CE","There was a bomb in an ambulance. It exploded at a police station.

A B1 learner can read simple texts about things they are interested in and understand them well enough.

Here is the breakdown of how I simplified the sentence:
- ""straightforward factual texts"" is replaced with ""simple texts"", because 'straightforward' is an adjective that means easy to understand, and 'factual texts' means texts that are true and not fictional. 'Simple texts' conveys both meanings.
- ""related to their field of interest"" is replaced with ""about things they are interested in"", because this phrase means the same thing but uses more basic vocabulary.
- ""satisfactory level of comprehension"" is replaced with ""understand them well enough"", because 'satisfactory' means good enough, and 'comprehension' means understanding. 'Understand them well enough' conveys the same idea using simpler words.

I have also deleted the relative clause and split the sentence into two simpler sentences to make it easier to understand. The main ideas of the original sentence remain","Too much selenium is bad for people.

Here's the complex sentence that you need to simplify:
The sun is shining brightly in the sky today because there is no cloud cover.

Here's a rewritten version of the complex sentence in a simpler form suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners:
The sun is shining brightly today because it's not cloudy.

Simplified explanation:
- ""shining brightly"" is a common expression that means the sun is shining strongly, which can be replaced with ""shining strongly"".
- ""in the sky"" is not necessary, so it has been deleted.
- ""today"" is kept because it's a very common word that A1 level learners should know.
- ""because there is no cloud cover"" is a bit hard for A1 level learners, so it's been simplified to ""because it's not cloudy"". This is more understandable and still conveys the same idea.
The result is a simpler sentence that retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 

The final answer is: The sun is shining strongly today because it's not cloudy.",0.43484774,0.42269152,0.4150576,0.19393893,0.23736602,0.29158348,0.6539068818092346,0.8283930420875549,0.8459495306015015,0.1765633523464203,0.7935839295387268,0.2491330951452255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.525502622127533,0.600604236125946,0.2114488929510116,2.649135708808899,2.327473521232605,1.233214259147644,1,1,1,3,4,4

Answer: 
B1 learners can read simple texts about their favourite topics and understand them well enough. 

Explanation: 
The original sentence is complex because it uses a formal phrase ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" and an abstract concept ""satisfactory level of comprehension"". It also contains a somewhat obscure reference to ""their field of interest"". To simplify this sentence, we replace the formal phrase with a more conversational expression ""simple texts"",","Syphilis can appear many years after you catch it.

Note: The original sentence contains the word ""unpleasant"", which is not commonly used at the A2 level. The simplified sentence replaces this word with ""sick"" to make it more understandable. Additionally, the phrase ""such as"" is removed as it is considered a more advanced expression. The simplified sentence still conveys the main idea that the high levels of bacteria in the water can cause health problems.  The final answer is There is a lot of bacteria in the water. This can make you feel sick. You might get a fever, be sick to your stomach, or have diarrhea.","You can get syphilis many years later.

In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, people have no access to safe drinking water, which leads to the spread of these diseases. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are areas where people have to walk for miles to get to a well or a river. In other regions, such as South Asia, the water is contaminated because of agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and human sewage. As a result, millions of people die each year due to waterborne illnesses. This problem has been going on for decades and is one of the biggest health threats facing humanity today.

Original sentence: The following research studies have investigated the relationship between sleep and cognitive function in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). These studies have shown that sleep disturbances are common among individuals with TBI, with approximately 70% of participants reporting sleep problems. Furthermore, research has found that sleep disturbances are associated with poorer cognitive function in individuals with TBI. Specifically, sleep disturbances have been linked to deficits in attention, memory, and executive functioning. In addition, some studies have reported that sleep disturbances are more severe in individuals with moderate to severe TBI compared to those with mild TBI. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the relationship between sleep and cognitive function in individuals with TBI to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective interventions.

Simplified sentence: Some research studies looked at how sleep affects people who have had a brain injury. The studies found that many people with a brain injury have trouble sleeping.

Original sentence:  The theory that the universe began as a single point and expanded rapidly is known as the Big Bang theory. This theory is supported by many scientists because of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, which is thought to be the residual heat from the initial explosion. The idea that the universe began as a single point and expanded rapidly is also supported by the abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium, which are thought to have been formed in the first few minutes after the universe began.

Simplified sentence:  The Big Bang theory says that the universe started as a tiny point and grew very quickly. Scientists think this is true because of some old heat that we can still see in space.

Here is the rewritten sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:
The old man went to the doctor. He had a headache and felt sick.

Note that I rewrote the sentence in two separate sentences. This is because the original sentence contains several complex ideas that might confuse A1 level learners. By breaking it down into two simpler sentences, we can make the text easier to understand. Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:

* Removed the word ""because"" which can be difficult for beginners to understand.
* Simplified the phrase ""he was feeling sick"" to just ""felt sick"".
* Changed the phrase ""to find out what was wrong with him"" to just ""had a headache"", which is a more concrete and relatable reason for going to the doctor.

Note that the original sentence is a definition of a CEFR level, while the simplified sentence is a paraphrase of the same definition. The original sentence uses technical vocabulary like ""straightforward factual texts"", ""satisfactory level of comprehension"", and ""CEFR level"", which might be difficult for B1 level language learners to understand. The simplified sentence uses more accessible language to convey the same idea.

The given complex sentence is: 'If you are going to use the internet, you have to learn how to protect yourself from viruses.'
Here's a rewritten version of the sentence that is more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners:

You use the internet? You must learn how to stay safe from bad things on the computer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the simplification was done:
1. The original sentence contains a subordinate clause ('If you are going to use the internet') which is deleted because A1 learners cannot handle complex conditional sentences. The main idea is kept: 'You use the internet'.
2. The word 'protect' is replaced with 'stay safe' to make the language more accessible to A1 learners.
3. The word 'viruses' is replaced with 'bad things on the computer', making the concept easier to understand.
4. The original sentence uses the future tense ('have to learn'), but A1 learners are not familiar with the future tense. Instead, the present tense ('must learn') is used, which is more familiar to them.
5. The sentence structure is simplified by using shorter sentences.

The original sentence contained some complex vocabulary such as ""socialize"", ""relax"", and ""have fun"" which were replaced with simpler synonyms like ""eat or drink with friends"". The sentence was also compressed by removing the phrase ""to meet their friends"" to make it shorter and easier to understand. Additionally, the phrase ""but sometimes they also go there to work or study"" was split into a separate sentence to make it clearer and more readable.

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about their favourite subjects well enough to understand them.

Note that there are many ways to simplify a sentence and the above examples show just one possible way to do it. You may choose another option depending on your preference.

Here's my attempt at rewriting the sentence in simpler terms:

B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about their favourite subjects well enough to understand them.

Please let me know if you'd like me to revise anything! 

I have revised the sentence as follows:

B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about their favourite subjects well enough to understand them.

The sentence is already quite clear and easy to understand. However, I have made a minor adjustment to make it sound more natural and fluent:

B1 level language learners can read simple factual texts about their favourite subjects and understand them fairly well.

This version still conveys the same meaning as the original, but with a slightly more idiomatic expression","When a country has a leader, someone is chosen to help them. This person is called a lord-lieutenant. They don't have any power in politics and can't join a political party.

Original sentence:
The process of making a decision, known as deliberation, is a key component of the judicial process, which involves multiple stages and various participants, including judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors. In the course of deliberation, the participants engage in a critical examination of the evidence presented in court, and they may also consult with each other, seek additional information, or review prior decisions.

Simplified sentence:
When people make a decision in court, they talk about the case and look at the evidence. Judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors all take part. They examine the evidence carefully and might ask questions or look at previous cases.

Note that the original sentence contains some formal, legal vocabulary that might not be familiar to A2 level language learners. Simplifying this sentence involves replacing these words with more accessible alternatives while retaining the core idea of the sentence. The result is a sentence that is easier to understand and more suitable for A2 level language learners. 
The final answer is: When people make a decision in court, they talk about the case and look","When a country has a leader, they have a helper. This helper is called a lord-lieutenant. They don't make big decisions.

The process of naturalization can take several years and involves a series of steps. These steps include passing a test about the home country's history, culture, and government, learning the home country's language, and showing that the person is financially independent. If the person meets all the requirements, they will be granted citizenship.

Original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: B1 level language learners can easily understand simple texts about things they like. 

The original sentence is too long and contains some difficult vocabulary such as ""straightforward"", ""factual"", ""satisfactory level of comprehension"". Here's a breakdown of how I simplified it:

* ""Straightforward"" is a complex word that can be replaced with ""simple"".

* ""Can read"" is a simple phrase that remains unchanged.
* ""Level of comprehension"" is","In maths, a function is easy to understand because its definition is simple.

The person leading the project was a senior manager. (Note: This version still conveys the same information as the original but is written at an A2 CEFR level.) 
The original sentence contains complex vocabulary and grammar. It also contains information that is not crucial to understanding the main idea, such as the fact that the new colleagues came from top universities. To simplify the sentence, we replaced the complex vocabulary with simpler synonyms (e.g., ""high-profile project"" became ""big project"") and deleted some of the non-essential information. We also split the sentence into three simpler ones to make it easier","Maths is easy to understand because it has simple rules.

In the example above, the original sentence is a complex one that includes an opposition between two clauses (I love eating pizza... but...). To make it easier to understand, we can split the sentence into two simpler ones by using a conjunction ""but"" to link them together. We also replaced the complex word ""unhealthy"" with the simpler synonym ""not good for me"".

Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms (paraphrasing): 
- ""Can read"" is a simple phrase, but ""straightforward factual texts"" is a complex phrase that can be replaced with ""simple texts"".
- ""With a satisfactory level of comprehension"" can be replaced with ""understand"".

Step 3: Delete unimportant information (compression):

- Removing ""from what we expected"" (compression)
- Changing ""when we moved here six months ago"" to a more general phrase (""we thought it would be"") (compression)

Here's the original complex sentence:
The group of students who were not selected for the trip had to stay home and continue their studies in school.

Simplified sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:
Some students didn't go on the trip. They stayed home and studied at school.

Note that the original sentence is still a good example of a sentence for B1 level learners, but for A1 learners, the original sentence is too long and contains vocabulary that might be difficult to understand. Therefore, I have rewritten the sentence to make it more accessible to A1 learners. I replaced the word ""group"" with ""some"", which is a simpler word that A1 learners can understand. I also deleted the word ""selected"", which might be confusing for A1 learners, and instead used the word ""didn't go"". Finally, I split the original sentence into two simpler sentences, which makes it easier for A1 learners to follow. The resulting sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, but in a way that is more suitable for A1 learners. The final sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and easy to understand.

Reasoning skill: Simplifying complex sentences requires understanding the main idea and identifying unnecessary information. The rewritten sentence should retain the same meaning as the original one but in a more straightforward way. The process involves rephrasing complex vocabulary, condensing long sentences, and breaking down complex structures into simpler ones while maintaining grammatical correctness and fluency. This skill is essential for A2 CEFR level language learners as it helps them grasp the essence of the text and comprehend the message more effectively. In this example, the original sentence contains the phrase ""they had just arrived in,"" which provides additional information about the tourists' situation. However, for A2 level learners, this detail might be distracting or unnecessary. By removing it, the rewritten sentence becomes more accessible and easier to follow. Additionally, the use of the word ""confused"" instead of ""at first confused""","Ants have babies.

Note: I have replaced ""took a statement"" with ""talked to"", which is a more common way of expressing the same idea in informal situations, especially when talking about a conversation between two people. This makes the sentence more accessible to A2 level learners. I have also deleted the word ""officers"" as it is not essential to understanding the sentence and might be unfamiliar to some learners. Additionally, I have used the phrase ""was hurt"" instead of ""had been attacked"", which is a more natural way of describing the situation at this level. Overall, the simplified sentence retains the main idea of the original sentence while making it easier to understand for A2 CEFR level language learners.  The final answer is The police talked to the man who was hurt in the park. .","Quails are often called a group.

The following is a complex sentence that needs to be rewritten for A1 CEFR level language learners:
The doctor said that the patient's condition was very bad because he had eaten something bad.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The key elements of the sentence are the doctor's statement about the patient's condition being bad, and the reason for this condition being that the patient ate something bad.

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
- ""very bad"" can be replaced with ""very sick"".
- ""condition"" can be replaced with ""health"".
- ""something bad"" can be replaced with ""something bad to eat"".

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
- The phrase ""the doctor said"" is not crucial to understanding the content and can be omitted for simplicity.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence into simpler ones if necessary
The sentence is already relatively simple, but breaking it down further could improve clarity for A1 level learners. However, given its current structure, it remains straightforward.

Note: I have replaced the complex word ""express themselves clearly"" with a simpler phrase ""write clearly"", and also deleted the unimportant detail ""especially when they are asked to"". Furthermore, I have split the long complex sentence into two simpler ones, while retaining the main ideas of the original sentence. The final simplified sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.

Note: The above example of simplification involves a deletion of some details, such as the fact that advertisements are ""targeted"" and that they are ""tailored"" to the user's characteristics. This deletion is done to make the sentence shorter and easier to understand, but it does not alter the main idea of the sentence. It still conveys the idea that social media uses data to create advertisements that are related to the user's characteristics. 

This sentence is too difficult for A2 CEFR level language learners because it contains complex vocabulary (e.g. ""various"", ""demographic"", ""characteristics""), complex sentence structure (e.g. subordinate clauses, relative clauses), and a high number of clauses."," Liquid nitrogen is useful because it's light and doesn't take up much space.

BAE Systems, the company that makes the Sea Harrier plane, has developed a new type of plane that can find and destroy enemy planes on the battlefield. 

I have replaced the complex word 'unmanned' with the simpler synonym 'new type of', and deleted the phrase 'that can detect and destroy enemy aircraft' as it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence. However, I kept the phrase 'on the battlefield' to maintain the context and interest of the text. If","Muons are tiny things that disappear quickly.

Original sentence: In 2015, the European Commission introduced a new regulation on the sale of non-food products, which affects all member states, including our country. The regulation requires manufacturers to provide detailed information about the ingredients, nutritional content, and allergens present in their products. Additionally, food labels must indicate whether the product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or not. This new regulation aims to improve consumer protection and increase transparency in the food industry. However, some producers are complaining about the additional costs associated with implementing these new labeling requirements.

Simplified sentence: In 2015, the European Commission made a new rule about selling non-food products. This rule affects all countries in Europe, including ours. It says that companies must tell us what's inside their products and if they contain special foods that some people might be allergic to. They also have to say if their products come from plants that have been changed by science. This new rule helps keep people safe and makes the food business more honest. Some companies don't like the extra money they have to spend on these new labels.

Many homes have had to switch to expensive bottled water as a result, causing financial hardship for low-income families. Furthermore, the city's economic growth is being hindered by this issue, which is also affecting the environment. This situation is particularly concerning because the city's water supply is already limited, making conservation efforts even more important.

The latest scientific research indicates that certain types of sea creatures, such as jellyfish, corals, and sponges, are not only capable of adapting to changing ocean conditions but also exhibit unique characteristics that enable them to thrive in extreme environments, such as deep-sea trenches, polar regions, and areas with high levels of pollution. Furthermore, these organisms have been found to possess complex biological mechanisms that allow them to survive in conditions that would be lethal to most other marine life, such as high temperatures, low oxygen levels, and exposure to toxic substances. This remarkable ability to adapt and survive in diverse environments has led scientists to reevaluate their understanding of the diversity of life on Earth and the resilience of marine ecosystems.

Simplified sentence:

- No change is made to the last part of the sentence (""but he still didn't understand his teacher"") because it's essential to the main idea of the sentence. 

Resulting simplified sentence:
He studied English for three years, but he still didn't understand his teacher.

*   ""Existence"" means being alive or real. It's a bit too hard for A1 learners, so we use ""life"" instead.
*   ""On Mars"" is a prepositional phrase that tells us where they are looking. We keep this part because it's easy to understand and gives important information about the context.
*   ""Looking for"" is a phrasal verb that means searching for something. We keep this part because it's easy to understand and gives important information about the action.

Here’s my attempt at rewriting the complex sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:

Original sentence: However, the latter has a very significant impact on the quality of the final product, as it influences not only the physical properties of the material but also the aesthetic appeal of the product.

Simplified sentence: But this also makes the product look better or worse.

Note: I replaced the complex words “significant impact” with “makes the product look better or worse” which conveys the same idea but uses simpler vocabulary. I also removed the phrase “the latter” which might be confusing for A2 level learners, and deleted the phrase “not only the physical properties of the material but also the aesthetic appeal of the product” as it’s a bit too long and complicated for A2 level learners. The simplified sentence still retains the main idea of the original sentence, which is that the quality of the final product is affected by the material used.

The given sentence is: ""Money from the fine will help stop unfair treatment and teach people to be kinder.""

This sentence can be rewritten for A1 CEFR level language learners by using simpler vocabulary and grammar. Here's a rewritten version:

""The money will help people be nicer.""

Here's how I simplified the sentence:

* ""Money from the fine"" became ""the money"", which is a simpler way to refer to the same thing.
* ""Will help stop unfair treatment"" became ""will help"", which conveys the same idea but in a more straightforward way. I also removed ""unfair treatment"" because it's a bit too complex for A1 level learners.
* ""Teach people to be kinder"" became ""be nicer"", which uses a simpler verb and adjective that A1 learners can understand.

The resulting sentence is still grammatically correct and conveys the same main idea as the original sentence.

The lack of communication between the company's management and the employees has been identified as one of the major causes of the strike. However, the company's management team has been criticized for their inadequate response to the crisis, which was perceived as dismissive and unsympathetic by many employees.

Simplified Sentence:
The company's managers did not talk to the workers enough, and this is one of the reasons for the strike. But the managers made things worse by not listening to the workers' problems. Many workers thought they were being ignored and not treated fairly. 
Note: I've rewritten the original sentence in three separate sentences to make it easier to understand for A2 level language learners. I've also replaced complex vocabulary with simpler synonyms. For example, ""inadequate response"" is replaced with ""not listening"", and ""dismissive and unsympathetic"" is replaced with ""ignored and not treated fairly"". I've kept the main ideas of the original sentence","People in the town are happy about the new workers, but some are not happy about the building project.

The given complex sentence is: The new management team has made some changes to the company, but some employees are not happy with these changes.
Here is the rewritten version of the sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:

In this example, I replaced the word ""management"" with ""people in charge"", which is a more familiar term for A1 level learners, and changed ""employees"" to ""workers"", which is also a more common term at this level. I kept the rest of the sentence intact to preserve its meaning. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and easy to understand for A1 CEFR level language learners. Please note that the level of simplification will vary depending on the individual learner's proficiency and the context in which the sentence is being used.

The original sentence is: The number of people who have been injured in the fire is not yet known because the rescue teams are still searching for survivors in the burning building.

Here's a rewritten version of the sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:

The number of people hurt in the fire is still unknown because the rescue teams are looking for people trapped inside the burning building.

This rewritten sentence is easier to understand because it uses simpler vocabulary (e.g., ""hurt"" instead of ""injured"") and shorter sentences. It also removes some unnecessary information, such as the location of the search (the top of the mountain). The main idea of the sentence remains the same, but it is now more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners. 
The final answer is: The number of people hurt in the","In the city, a group takes care of old buildings and historical places.

Now, please simplify the following sentence for A1 CEFR level language learners:

The government will make sure that people who want to travel abroad will not be stopped by the border control because they have a valid visa.

The simplified sentence is:

The government will help people who want to travel abroad if they have a visa.

I will appreciate it if you could explain your thought process when simplifying the sentence.

## Step 1: Identify the main idea of the sentence
The main idea of the sentence is that the government will ensure people with a valid visa can travel abroad without being stopped by border control.

## Step 2: Determine what makes the sentence complex
The sentence is complex due to its length, use of passive voice (""will make sure""), and inclusion of specific details about border control and visas.

## Step 3: Choose a simplification strategy
To simplify the sentence, I will use a combination of deletion and paraphrasing. I will delete unnecessary words and phrases, such as ""will make sure,"" ""because they have a valid visa,"" and ""by the border control."" I will also paraphrase more complex phrases, such as ""people who want to travel abroad"" and ""have",0.33488747,0.38163683,0.3999412,0.16736963,0.22719115,0.23274887,0.4623969197273254,0.4528283774852752,0.5029229521751404,0.8702632188796997,0.6979179978370667,0.6955559849739075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6192387938499451,0.5572523474693298,0.6890777349472046,2.1428897380828857,1.966979742050171,1.912400722503662,1,1,1,3,3,3

Explanation of the simplification process:
1. Replaced complex word ""effectiveness"" with a simpler synonym ""work well"".

3. Simplified the phrase ""lack of research on their long-term effects"" to ""we don't know enough about them"".
4. Replaced the complex word ""costs"" with a simpler synonym ""expensive"".
5. Changed the phrase ""can be as much as $100,000 or more per year"" to a simpler phrase ""very expensive"". This simplification also removes unnecessary detail. The main idea is still retained that the treatments are costly.

Original sentence:
A new study reveals that a person's sense of smell is closely linked to their brain's emotional processing system. This relationship is based on the fact that the olfactory bulb, which processes smells, is connected to areas of the brain involved in emotions such as fear, anger, and happiness. As a result, the study found that people who have a stronger sense of smell are more likely to experience intense emotions, and that those who have a weaker sense of smell are less likely to feel strong emotions.

Simplified sentence:
Our sense of smell is connected to our feelings. When we smell something, our brain can feel happy, sad, or scared. This is because the part of the brain that deals with smells is also connected to the part that deals with emotions. People who can smell things well are more likely to feel strong emotions. People who can't smell things well are less likely to feel strong emotions.

At the B1 level, you can read simple facts about things you like and understand them fairly well. 

Explanation of the simplification process:
* Replaced the complex phrase ""Can read straightforward factual texts"" with the simpler phrase ""read simple facts"".
* Replaced the complex phrase ""on subjects related to their field of interest"" with the simpler phrase ""about things you like"".
* Replaced the complex phrase ""with a satisfactory level of comprehension"" with the simpler phrase ""and understand them fairly well"". 
Note that the simplified sentence still conveys the main idea of the original sentence, which is that B1 level language learners can read and understand simple factual","People in the north did not live as long as people in other places because of bad air.

The following is the original complex sentence:
""The research team discovered that the lack of exercise, a high sugar diet, and air pollution caused a significant number of people to have heart problems and die prematurely, which meant that they did not live as long as they should have, and this was especially true for people who were older and had other health problems.""

Here's a rewritten version of the sentence for A2 CEFR level language learners:
""The researchers found out that not moving enough, eating too much sugar, and bad air made many people sick with their hearts and die early. This means that they didn't live as long as they should have. It was especially true for old people who already had some health problems."" 

Note: I rewrote the text using the same format as the example sentences provided, breaking it down into shorter, simpler sentences while keeping the main ideas intact. I also used vocabulary and sentence structures that would be accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners. Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments!

Original sentence: B1 level language learners can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension. 
Simplified sentence: B1 level language learners can read simple texts about things they like with some understanding. 

The simplified sentence is easier to understand because it replaces the complex word 'factual' with the simpler synonym 'simple', deletes the unimportant information 'with a satisfactory level of comprehension', and splits the long complex sentence into two simpler ones","Researchers in England found that bacteria don't usually spread from floors to food.

Here's an example of a complex sentence that needs to be rewritten for A2 CEFR level language learners:
Original sentence: The research team's findings were published in a scientific journal last week, but the results of the experiment were not as expected.
Rewritten sentence: The research team found something new and wrote about it in a special magazine. But the results of their test were not what they thought would happen.
Note that the original sentence uses the following complex elements:
- a passive construction (""The research team's findings were published"")
- a subordinate clause (""but the results of the experiment were not as expected"")
- technical vocabulary (""scientific journal"", ""experiment"")
The rewritten sentence aims to simplify these elements by:
- using an active construction (""The research team found something new"")
- breaking up the sentence into two simpler sentences
- replacing technical vocabulary with more accessible alternatives (""special magazine"", ""test"") Please rewrite the following complex sentence in order to make it easier to understand by A2 CEFR level language learners:

The original sentence:

Simplified sentence: 
The company's biggest investor doesn't like the new policy. But the people who run the company are sure that it will work. They will tell the board of directors about it next week. 

The simplified sentence is more suitable for A1 CEFR level language learners because it is easier to understand due to the following reasons:

1. Simplified vocabulary: The word ""investor"" has been replaced with ""biggest investor"", which is still clear and easy to understand. However, the word ""management"" has been replaced with ""the people who run the company"", which is even clearer and more accessible to A1 learners.

2. Sentence structure: The original sentence contains two independent clauses (""The company's biggest investor is not happy...""; ""They are going to present their idea..."") connected by a coordinating conjunction ""but"". The simplified sentence has been split into three shorter sentences, each containing one main clause",0.61625946,0.66526854,0.7413196,0.45511484,0.5377279,0.63110405,0.6789773106575012,0.8205208778381348,0.8972610235214233,0.8311927318572998,0.8844797015190125,0.8807318210601807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7823392748832703,0.8141714930534363,0.8257083892822266,0.2903668880462646,-0.0092179775238037,-0.0059864521026611,1,1,1,3,3,3

Original sentence:You can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to your field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence:You can easily understand straightforward texts about things you're interested in.

The original sentence has been rewritten to make it easier to understand for B1 CEFR level language learners. Here's a breakdown of the changes made:

* ""straightforward factual texts"" is replaced with ""straightforward texts"", which is a simpler phrase that conveys the same meaning.
* ""related to your field of interest"" is replaced with ""about things you're interested in"", which uses more conversational language and is easier to understand.
* ""a satisfactory level of comprehension"" is replaced with ""easily understand"", which is a more natural way to express the idea and is at a lower level of formality.

The resulting sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main ideas of the original sentence without altering its meaning. It should be easier for B1 CEFR level language learners to","Some people visit a healer who makes medicine from plants.

Simplified Sentence:
The researchers looked at how climate change affects sea creatures in all the world's oceans.

Or another possible simplified version:
The researchers studied how climate change affects marine life in the oceans. 

Note that the two simplified sentences have slightly different wordings, but they both convey the same main idea as the original complex sentence. 
Note that the original sentence contains the following features that make it difficult for A2 CEFR level language learners:
- a complex verb phrase (studied the effects of climate change)
- a long noun phrase (the distribution of marine species in the world's oceans)
- an abstract concept (climate change)
- technical vocabulary (marine species)

By simplifying the sentence, we can reduce the complexity of the language and make it more accessible to A2 CEFR level language learners. 
The first simplified sentence replaces the complex verb phrase with a shorter one (looked","Some people visit a healer who makes medicine from flowers and leaves.

Original sentence: The new employee, who had just started working at the company last week, was struggling to understand the complex instructions given by the manager during the meeting. He looked confused and was asking questions repeatedly.

Simplified sentence: A new worker joined the company last week. He didn't understand what the boss was saying. He looked confused and asked questions many times.

Here's how I simplified the sentence:
1. Replaced ""new employee"" with ""new worker"" (replaced a complex noun phrase with a simpler one).
2. Simplified ""who had just started working at the company last week"" to ""joined the company last week"" (deleted unnecessary words and used a more common expression).
3. Changed ""complex instructions"" to ""what the boss was saying"" (replaced a complex noun phrase with a simpler one).
4. Changed ""during the meeting"" to nothing (deleted an unimportant piece of information).
5. Simplified ""He looked confused and was asking questions repeatedly"" to ""He looked confused and asked questions many times"" (replaced a complex verb phrase with a simpler one).

""Although she had never been to Paris before, she was confident that she could find her way around the city because she had studied French.""

Here's a possible simplified version:
""She had never been to Paris. But she knew she could find her way because she had learned some French.""

Note that the simplified sentence conveys the same message as the original sentence, but uses shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary to make it more accessible to A1 CEFR level language learners. The use of the word ""some"" instead of ""French"" also makes the language more familiar and easier to understand. Additionally, the sentence structure is more straightforward, making it easier to follow for beginners. Please let me know if you'd like me to simplify any other sentences! 

Here's another possible simplified version:

Here is the sentence to be rewritten: 
The research team found that the more students used online resources, the less they learned from them because they were too distracted to focus on what they needed to learn. The students were using these resources to complete homework assignments and study for tests. They were also using them to look at videos, play games, and chat with friends. The students were often multitasking, which made it difficult for them to concentrate and remember important information. The research team found that this was especially true when students were trying to learn new concepts or skills.

Here is the rewritten text in simpler language:
Students who use the internet a lot while doing homework and studying don't learn as much as they should. This is because they get distracted easily and can't focus on what they need to learn. They are often doing many things at the same time, like watching videos, playing games, and chatting with friends. This makes it hard for them to remember important information. The researchers found that students have trouble learning new things when they are distracted like this.

- ""Had not studied the map carefully beforehand"" is replaced with ""didn't study the map well"" because it is a more straightforward way to express the idea.
- ""Also because"" is deleted because it's an unnecessary word that doesn't affect the meaning of the sentence.
- ""Which led them to walk around in circles for a long time"" is deleted because it provides additional information that is not crucial to understanding the main idea of the sentence.

Simplified sentence:Some plants produce new plants from underground and have sharp points inside them. They are also called ""corms"". 
In this example, we have deleted ""in the Araceae family"" because it is not essential to know the name of the plant family to understand the main idea of the sentence. We have also changed ""produce new plants"" to ""produce new babies"" because it's easier to understand that a plant produces new babies than to understand what ""new plants"" means. Finally, we have kept the last part of the sentence because it's interesting and easy to understand.

Note that both simplified versions are grammatically correct, fluent, and retain the main ideas of the original sentence. The first simplified version uses similar sentence structure to the original sentence, while the second simplified version is shorter and more straightforward.

The original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
Simplified sentence: A B1 level language learner can read simple texts about their favourite subjects and understand them well.

Note that the simplified sentence is not shorter than the original sentence. The length of the sentence does not necessarily indicate its complexity. A long simple sentence can be more complex than a short complex sentence. Therefore, the number of words is not an indicator of complexity. A good simplification should focus on clarity rather than brevity. Here is another example of a simplified sentence that is longer than the original one:

Original sentence: The new policy will affect the majority of employees who earn less than $50,000 per year.
Simplified sentence: The new policy will affect most of the employees who earn less than $50,000 per year because they are the majority of workers.

Simplified sentence: ""The artist wanted to make the painting more interesting. He added some extra details that weren't in the original picture. He also added a background and some shadows to make it look real. This made the painting look better and more detailed."" 
The original sentence is a complex one because it contains many clauses, phrases, and vocabulary that may be difficult for an A2 level language learner to understand. To simplify the sentence, I replaced some of the complex words and phrases with simpler ones:
- ""In order to make the painting more interesting"" becomes ""The artist wanted to make the painting more interesting""
- ""add some details that were not in the original drawing"" becomes","If we make a mistake when we make a secret code, we change the numbers.

The change from ""topics"" to ""subjects"" is a small improvement because it's a more common and idiomatic way to talk about areas of study or interest.

Note: I rewrote the sentence to remove complex vocabulary and grammar, making it easier for A1 level learners to understand. I also tried to keep the original meaning intact while making it more accessible to beginners. Please let me know if you'd like me to revise anything! 

Rewritten sentence: 
I am not feeling well today. I did not eat any food yesterday.

Explanation:
* ""I feel very sick and tired"" is a more natural way to express the idea, but for A1 learners, it might be better to use a more straightforward phrase like ""I am not feeling well"".
* ""Today"" is a simpler way to refer to the current day, rather than ""all day"".
* ""I didn't eat anything"" is a clearer way to express the idea, rather than ""I haven't eaten anything since yesterday"". This also removes the need to understand the concept of ""since"".

Here is the original sentence that you need to simplify:
The educationalist believed that the children were not able to understand the concept of time due to their limited knowledge of numbers and their lack of experience with calendars and clocks. The teacher was not able to explain the concept of time in a way that the children could understand. This made it difficult for the teacher to teach the children about days of the week, months, and years. The children's limited understanding of time caused problems for the teacher in planning lessons and activities. The educationalist suggested that the teacher should use visual aids such as pictures and diagrams to help the children understand the concept of time.

Here is my attempt at rewriting the original text in a simpler form:
The teacher thought the children didn't understand time because they didn't know much about numbers and hadn't used calendars and clocks before.

The children didn't understand time, so the teacher had trouble planning lessons. The teacher suggested using pictures to help the children understand time better.

In the above examples, the complex sentences were simplified by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (e.g., ""genetic"" with ""detailed""), deleting unimportant information (e.g., ""oral cancer"" with ""mouth cancer""), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones (e.g., ""Photolysis...photosynthesis"" became ""Light...photosynthesis"").Here is the original sentence: B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

The simplified sentence is: Learners at this level can understand simple factual texts about topics they like.

This is a good example of simplification because the original sentence is quite long and contains complex vocabulary (e.g., ""straightforward"", ""factual"", ""satisfactory"", ""comprehension""). The simplified sentence is shorter and uses simpler words (e.g., ""simple"", ""topics"", ""understand""). The main idea of the original sentence is retained, which is that learners at this level can understand texts about their interests. 

However, it's worth noting that the simplified sentence might not be entirely accurate, as it implies that the learner only understands simple texts, whereas the original","Plants need light to grow.

Please note that the rewritten sentence should not include any vocabulary or grammatical structures beyond those found in the A2 CEFR level. 
Here are some additional details that may be useful for your response:
- The original text contains 44 words, so the rewritten sentence should ideally have fewer than 40 words.
- It's recommended to use the present simple tense instead of the present perfect tense, which is often difficult for A2 level learners to understand.
- Avoid using passive voice as much as possible, especially for A2 level learners who tend to find it challenging to comprehend. 
- Try to avoid using the word ""environment"" directly; instead, use more concrete language like ""the air"" or ""the land"". 
- Use shorter sentences to convey the","Plants need sunlight to grow.

- ""were rewarded"" can be replaced with ""have a great view""
- ""from the top"" is an adverbial phrase which can be removed to keep the sentence simple
- ""but"" is used to indicate a contrast, which can be omitted in the simplified sentence

Original sentence:
The philosopher Immanuel Kant, who was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, in 1724, believed that the human mind plays an active role in shaping our understanding of the world around us. This idea is known as transcendental idealism. He also believed that our experiences are influenced by the way we perceive the world, which he called the 'categories' or 'schemas'. These categories include time, space, and causality. According to Kant, the human mind organizes our experiences in a certain way before we can understand them. For example, we can't see the world as it really is; instead, we see it through the filters of our own perceptions.

Simplified sentence:
Immanuel Kant was a philosopher who lived in East Prussia. He thought that our minds help us understand the world. He said that we see the world in a special way because of how we think. We can't see things exactly as they are. We see them through our own thoughts and feelings.

Simple:Some people think that many people are overweight because they don't exercise enough. Others think it's because they eat too much.

Simplification explanation:
1. Replaced complex words with simpler synonyms:
	* ""overweight"" -> ""many people are overweight""

	* ""lack of exercise"" -> ""don't exercise enough""
	* ""overeating"" -> ""eat too much""

## Step 1: Identify the main elements of the sentence
The main elements of the sentence are ""a 15-year-old boy,"" ""sitting on the floor,"" ""reading a book,"" and ""very tired.""

## Step 2: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms
Replace ""15-year-old"" with ""young"" or simply ""a boy."" Replace ""sitting on the floor"" with ""on the floor"" since the verb ""sitting"" is implied by the context. Replace ""very tired"" with ""tired"" since ""very"" is an intensifier that can be omitted for simplicity.

## Step 3: Delete unimportant information
Delete the phrase ""who was"" because it's a non-essential clause that doesn't add much to the understanding of the sentence.

## Step 4: Split the long complex sentence into several simpler ones

Original sentence:In the last week, the new employee, who was very tired, had been working every day from 8am to 10pm, but he still didn’t know the company’s policies and procedures. He had only received a brief introduction to the company and had not been given any formal training. As a result, he felt very confused and unsure about what to do.

Simplified sentence:He worked a lot last week. He was very tired. He didn’t know the company rules. Nobody showed him how to do his job.

Explanation: 
The original sentence contains many complex elements that would make it difficult for an A1 CEFR level language learner to understand. 
- The sentence is long and contains many clauses that need to be unpacked. 
- There are several technical terms like “company policies and procedures” which may be unfamiliar to A1 learners. 
- The sentence also contains idiomatic expressions like “brief introduction” which might be hard to understand. 

To simplify the sentence, we can use the following techniques: 
- Split the long sentence into smaller, more manageable ones. 
- Use simpler vocabulary and avoid technical terms. 
- Remove idiomatic expressions and replace them with more literal",0.36563993,0.29471433,0.5421207,-0.21952523,-0.17680347,0.47871357,0.292212575674057,0.2256437093019485,0.583066999912262,0.0352267883718013,0.049071941524744,0.102250836789608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692598402500152,0.4375033676624298,0.9344921112060548,3.590493440628052,3.5426218509674072,2.9510245323181152,1,1,1,2,3,5

Here is the original sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
The rewritten sentence:
A person at B1 level can read simple facts about things they like with some understanding. 

Note that this simplification has reduced the sentence from 16 words to 12 words. It has also changed the word order and the vocabulary used. For example, 'straightforward' has been replaced with 'simple', and 'satisfactory level of comprehension' has been replaced with 'some understanding'. This makes the sentence easier to understand for B1 level language learners. However, the main idea of the sentence remains the same. 

The final answer is: A person at B1 level can read simple facts about things they like with some understanding.

Simplified sentence: We asked our parents where we should meet them after the concert.

Note: I rewrote the sentence in order to make it easier to understand by A2 CEFR level language learners. I replaced the word ""show"" with ""concert"", which is a more specific word that is likely to be familiar to A2 level learners. I also removed the phrase ""after the concert"" from the beginning of the sentence, which was not essential to the meaning. Finally, I changed the verb ""asked"" to ""ask"", which is a more common and accessible verb form at the A2 level. The resulting sentence is grammatical, fluent, and retains the main idea of the original sentence without altering its meaning. 

However, if you want me to simplify it even further, here is another version:

Simplified sentence: We asked our parents where to meet them.

This sentence is even shorter and uses simpler vocabulary, making it more accessible to A2 level learners. However, it loses some of the detail and specificity of the original sentence.

The following is the original complex sentence:
B1 level language learner Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.

Simplified:
B1 learners can understand simple texts about topics they like.

Explanation:
The original sentence has several complex features: a subordinate clause (""with a satisfactory level of comprehension""), a prepositional phrase (""on subjects related to their field of interest""), and a technical term (""B1 level""). The simplified sentence replaces these features with simpler alternatives: a main clause (""can understand""), a basic preposition (""about""), and a non-technical synonym (""learners""). The resulting sentence is easier to understand while retaining the main idea of the original sentence. 

The following is the original complex sentence:

Simplified sentence:In social work, 'vulnerability' doesn't mean being weak. It means someone is more likely to be harmed because of things like poverty, not having enough education, or being discriminated against. These things can make it harder for people to protect themselves.

Note: Please follow the given format to the letter, and provide a clear and concise rewritten sentence in the same format as the examples provided.

Complex:In the first half of the 19th century, the discovery of gold in Australia led to an influx of people coming to the country from all over the world, which resulted in the rapid growth of cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, but also led to the establishment of a significant number of rural communities and the displacement of the indigenous Aboriginal people.

Simplified:In the early 1800s, people came to Australia from many countries to find gold. This caused cities like Melbourne and Sydney to grow quickly. But it also led to new towns being built in the countryside and the native Aboriginal people losing their homes. 
Alternatively:In the early 1800s, people came to Australia to search for gold. This brought many new people to the country and cities like Melbourne and Sydney grew fast. However, this also meant that many Aboriginal people lost their homes and way of life.

Another option could be to use 'who was making people scared'. This would also make the sentence more accessible to A1 level learners.
