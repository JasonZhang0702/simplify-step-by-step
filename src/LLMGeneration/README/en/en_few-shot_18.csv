### Step 1: Identify the key elements of the original sentence
The original sentence is ""You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones."" The key elements are the methods of simplifying a complex sentence: paraphrasing, compression, and splitting.

### Step 2: Determine the purpose of simplification
The purpose of simplification is to make the sentence easier to understand for 1 CEFR level language learners, which means using shorter sentences, simpler vocabulary, and a more straightforward structure.

### Step 3: Apply the methods of simplification
- Paraphrasing: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms. For example, ""simplifying"" instead of ""paraphrasing"".
- Compression: Delete unimportant information. In this case, the sentence is already quite general, so there's limited room for compression.
- Splitting: Break down a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The original sentence is already quite short, so this might not be necessary.

### Step 4: Rewrite the sentence

Secondly, people could create and share their own maps using a free service called OpenStreetMap. Thirdly, Google Earth was launched, making it easy to look at satellite images.

Original Sentence: After time, some of these stimuli become adapted and we cease to remark on their significance, because our brain's processing mechanism adjusts to them, and they become part of the background noise, no longer deserving of attention.

Simplified Sentence: We stop paying attention to things after a while because our brains get used to them. They become part of the background noise and don't seem important anymore.

Note: I removed ""stimuli"" which might not be familiar to 2 CEFR level learners, and ""processing mechanism"" which is a bit complex, and ""deserving of attention"" which is a formal expression. I also changed ""cease to remark"" to ""stop paying attention"" to make the sentence more natural.

Greek influence expanded greatly as the city-state of Naucratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium.

Complex: The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) suggests that people's intentions to perform a behaviour are influenced by their attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. However, the TPB does not consider the role of habits in shaping behaviour. Therefore, a new theory, the theory of planned behaviour plus habit (TPBH), was developed to take into account the impact of habits on behaviour. The TPBH proposes that habits can influence behaviour independently of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Moreover, the TPBH suggests that habits can override the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on behaviour. Finally, the TPBH proposes that habits can be a major determinant of behaviour, especially in situations where there is little motivation or ability to control the environment.

Wikipedia,Natural Sciences,"Within the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. Plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds. Eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles. In terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of tubulin (e.g., α-tubulin and β-tubulin whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins.

Simplified sentence: Eukaryotic cells have a skeleton. It helps the cell and moves things inside the cell.
Here's how I rewrote the sentence:
- I replaced ""cytoskeleton"" with ""skeleton"", which is a more familiar word for 1 CEFR level language learners.
- I deleted ""made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments"", because it's not crucial information for understanding the main idea of the sentence.
- I changed ""all of which"" to ""It"", to make the sentence clearer and more concise.
- I rephrased ""provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles"" to ""helps the cell and moves things inside the cell"", to make it more understandable for 1 CEFR level language learners. 

The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct,","Animal cells have a special skeleton that helps them stand up straight and move around.

Original Sentence:
The main difference between these two galaxies lies in the fact that the galaxy with the higher redshift is not as massive as the one with the lower redshift. This is because the galaxy with the higher redshift has an orbital period of 2.5 billion years, which is much longer than the 1.8 billion year orbital period of the galaxy with the lower redshift. Furthermore, the galaxy with the higher redshift is moving away from us at a speed of 500 km/s, while the galaxy with the lower redshift is moving away from us at a speed of 200 km/s. This means that the galaxy with the higher redshift is receding from us much faster than the galaxy with the lower redshift.

Simplified Sentence:

Wikipedia,Natural Sciences,"Animals can reproduce in one of two ways: asexual and sexual. Nearly all animals engage in some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis. The smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs. Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids."," It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.

Wikipedia,Philosophy,"The word ""humanism"" derives from the Latin concept humanitas, which was first used by Cicero to describe values related to liberal education, a sense which survives in the modern university concept of the ""humanities"": the arts, philosophy, history, literature, and related disciplines. The word reappeared during the Italian Renaissance as umanista and entered the English language in the 16th century. The word ""humanist"" was used to describe a group of students of classical literature and those advocating for education based on it. In the early 19th century, the term Humanismus was used in Germany with several meanings and from there, it re-entered the English language with two distinct denotations; one an academic term linked to the study of classic literature while the other, more popular use signified a non-religious approach to life, implying an antithesis to theism. It is probable Bavarian theologian Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools. Soon, other scholars such as Georg Voigt and Jacob Burckhardt adopted the term. In the 20th century, the word was further refined, acquiring its contemporary meaning of a naturalistic approach to life, focusing on the well-being and freedom of humans.Defining humanism reveals the controversy surrounding humanism. For philosopher Sidney Hook, writing in 1974, humanists are opposed to the imposition of one culture in some civilizations, do not belong to a church or established religion, do not support dictatorships, do not justify violence for social reforms or are more loyal to an organization than their abstract values. Hook also said humanists support the elimination of  hunger and improvements to health, housing, and education. Also in 1974, Humanist philosopher H. J. Blackham said humanism is a concept that focuses on improving the social conditions of humanity, increasing the autonomy and dignity of all humans. In 1999, Jeaneane D. Fowler said the definition of humanism should include a rejection of divinity, and an emphasis on human well-being and freedom. She also comments there is a lack of a shared belief system or doctrine but, in general, humanists are aiming for happiness and self-fulfillment.In 2015, prominent humanist Andrew Copson attempted to define humanism as follows:"," Soon, other scholars such as Georg Voigt and Jacob Burckhardt adopted the term. In the 20th century, the word was further refined, acquiring its contemporary meaning of a naturalistic approach to life, focusing on the well-being and freedom of humans.Defining humanism reveals the controversy surrounding humanism.

Wikipedia,Philosophy,"Many authors have written about excess deaths under Communist states and mortality rates, such as excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. Some authors posit that there is a Communist death toll, whose death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of the deaths that are included in them, ranging from lows of 10–20 million to highs over 100 million. The higher estimates have been criticized by several scholars as ideologically motivated and inflated; they are also criticized for being inaccurate due to incomplete data, inflated by counting any excess death, making an unwarranted link to communism, and the grouping and body-counting itself. Higher estimates account for actions that Communist governments committed against civilians, including executions, man-made famines, and deaths that occurred during, or resulted from, imprisonment, and forced deportations and labor. Higher estimates are criticized for being based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable, skewed to higher possible values, and victims of civil wars, the Holodomor and other famines, and war-related events should not be included.

Original complex sentence:
You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence needs to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.

Simplified sentence:
To make a difficult text easier to understand, you can replace hard words with easier ones, remove unnecessary details, or break it up into shorter sentences. The result should still make sense and sound good when spoken.

Or, in an even simpler form:
To make a text easier to understand, you can replace hard words with easier ones, cut out what's not important, or split it into smaller sentences. The result should still make sense. 

Note that the simplified sentence is not as polished as the original sentence, but it retains the same ideas and is easier to understand for a 3 CEFR level language learner.

### Step-by-Step Solution
To simplify the given sentence, we will follow the same approach as the examples provided:

Original Sentence: You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones.

1. **Paraphrasing**: Replace complex words with simpler synonyms.
   - ""complex words"" -> ""hard words""
   - ""paraphrasing"" -> ""using simpler words""
   - ""deleting unimportant information"" -> ""leaving out unnecessary details""
   - ""compression"" -> ""shortening""

2. **Compression**: Delete unimportant information.
   - The sentence about ""CEFR level language learners"" can be removed as it provides background information but is not crucial for understanding the process of simplifying sentences.

3. **Splitting**: Split a long complex sentence into several simpler ones.
   - Original sentence is already relatively simple, so no further splitting is necessary.

Simplified Sentence: To make a text easier to understand, you can use simpler words, leave out unnecessary details, and break it down into shorter sentences.

Please do not confuse the two concepts of causality and correlation.
Causality refers to a relationship between two variables where one variable causes another variable to change.
Correlation, on the other hand, does not necessarily imply causation.
A correlation exists when there is a statistical relationship between two variables, but this does not mean that one variable causes the other variable to change.
In fact, there may be many other factors involved.
Here is the rewritten text in the format requested:
Complex:Please do not confuse the two concepts of causality and correlation, which are often misinterpreted in discussions about social phenomena, as they refer to fundamentally different relationships between variables.

David Caron had warned that the form of the Articles would overshadow disagreements over substance: that, entranced by their neat form, practitioners of international law would overlook some of the deep uncertainties that lingered in some parts of the Articles. This was the ‘paradox’ of the relationship between form and authority.127 The paradox was perhaps overstated: the authority of the Articles rests not just in the body that produced the text, but in the role of States both during their drafting and in their engagement with the Articles ever since. The hope is that the General Assembly’s current stalemate in respect of the final status of the Articles will not invert this paradox: that disagreements over form may begin to overshadow the substance of the Articles.","Whatever the case, however, it is crucial that States in the General Assembly make a decision on their final status.","David Caron had warned that the form of the Articles would overshadow disagreements over substance: that, entranced by their neat form, practitioners of international law would overlook some of the deep uncertainties that lingered in some parts of the Articles.",4,"David Caron said that people might like the way the articles look but they have some problems.

Ago’s ‘revolution’, like many successful revolutions, built on the work of pioneers.

Anzilotti’s influence on Ago is clear from the latter’s 1939 course at The Hague Academy of International Law, ‘Le Délit International’, and was openly acknowledged.

The development of the map as a tool for navigation has a long history dating back to ancient times, with early cartographers employing various techniques to create detailed maps that could be used to facilitate safe passage and convey important information to mariners. In addition to these practical considerations, the aesthetic appeal of maps has also played a significant role in their development, with cartographers often using artistic skills to create visually appealing and informative maps that not only convey geographical information but also tell stories and evoke emotions. As a result, the design of maps has evolved over time to include a wide range of styles, from the simple and straightforward to the complex and ornate, reflecting the changing needs and values of society. Today, the use of digital technologies has further transformed the field of cartography, enabling the creation of highly interactive and dynamic maps that can be easily accessed and shared online. Despite these advances, however, the fundamental principles of map-making remain unchanged, with cartographers continuing to rely on basic techniques such as projection, scale, and symbology to convey geographical information in a clear and concise manner.

Research and Innovation,Politics,"In their extensive reviews of the political communication literature, Bucy and D’Angelo (1999, 2004) identify three sustained criticisms of the press in politics, formulated as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis. Whether intentional or not, these critiques embrace a neoconservative perspective on public life where media are seen to have a corrosive role in political processes. In this view, more espoused by political scientists than communication scholars, journalistic values are at odds with political values, which results in a news agenda that misrepresents what is at stake. The news media thus distort political reality and fail their information role – a major proposition, along with media interventionism, that emerges from the broader crisis of political communication practice that has been incubating for some time.",,"In their extensive reviews of the political communication literature, Bucy and D’Angelo (1999, 2004) identify three sustained criticisms of the press in politics, formulated as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis.",5,"Two researchers wrote about the problems between the press and government.

From this analysis, we find that there has been a noticeable increase in the internationalization of research in political communication from 1996-2016. The bias of political science previously identified in the literature appears to have subsided, at least in the two journals analyzed here, owing perhaps to the explosion of new platforms and delivery technologies that have integrated their way into politics in unforeseen ways.

Original sentence:
The new health care reform, which was introduced in 2010, will not only provide access to affordable healthcare for millions of Americans, but also reduce the financial burden on individuals and families who have been struggling with high medical bills. However, this new law will not address the issue of the rising cost of healthcare, which is expected to continue to increase over the next few years, and therefore, it is likely that individuals and families will still face significant financial burdens due to high medical costs. Furthermore, the new law will not cover all necessary medical procedures, leaving some patients with no choice but to pay out-of-pocket for expensive treatments. In contrast, some argue that the new law will actually increase healthcare costs in the long run, as it will lead to an influx of new patients seeking medical care, thereby putting pressure on healthcare providers and driving up costs.

Simplified sentence:
The new healthcare law will help many people get cheaper healthcare. But it won't solve the problem of high healthcare costs. People may still have to pay a lot for medical treatment.
