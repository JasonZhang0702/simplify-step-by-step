Wikipedia,Arts and Culture,"Drawing is used to express one's creativity, and therefore has been prominent in the world of art. Throughout much of history, drawing was regarded as the foundation for artistic practice. Initially, artists used and reused wooden tablets for the production of their drawings. Following the widespread availability of paper in the 14th century, the use of drawing in the arts increased. At this point, drawing was commonly used as a tool for thought and investigation, acting as a study medium whilst artists were preparing for their final pieces of work. The Renaissance brought about a great sophistication in drawing techniques, enabling artists to represent things more realistically than before, and revealing an interest in geometry and philosophy.The invention of the first widely available form of photography led to a shift in the hierarchy of the arts. Photography offered an alternative to drawing as a method for accurately representing visual phenomena, and traditional drawing practice was given less emphasis as an essential skill for artists, particularly so in Western society."," Following the widespread availability of paper in the 14th century, the use of drawing in the arts increased.

Greek influence expanded greatly as the city-state of Naucratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrap. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty, ended in 402 BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the Thirtieth, proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of Nectanebo II.

Wikipedia,Natural Sciences,"Animals can reproduce in one of two ways: asexual and sexual. Nearly all animals engage in some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis. The smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs. Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids."," It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.

Wikipedia,Philosophy,"The word ""humanism"" derives from the Latin concept humanitas, which was first used by Cicero to describe values related to liberal education, a sense which survives in the modern university concept of the ""humanities"": the arts, philosophy, history, literature, and related disciplines. The word reappeared during the Italian Renaissance as umanista and entered the English language in the 16th century. The word ""humanist"" was used to describe a group of students of classical literature and those advocating for education based on it. In the early 19th century, the term Humanismus was used in Germany with several meanings and from there, it re-entered the English language with two distinct denotations; one an academic term linked to the study of classic literature while the other, more popular use signified a non-religious approach to life, implying an antithesis to theism. It is probable Bavarian theologian Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools. Soon, other scholars such as Georg Voigt and Jacob Burckhardt adopted the term. In the 20th century, the word was further refined, acquiring its contemporary meaning of a naturalistic approach to life, focusing on the well-being and freedom of humans.Defining humanism reveals the controversy surrounding humanism. For philosopher Sidney Hook, writing in 1974, humanists are opposed to the imposition of one culture in some civilizations, do not belong to a church or established religion, do not support dictatorships, do not justify violence for social reforms or are more loyal to an organization than their abstract values. Hook also said humanists support the elimination of  hunger and improvements to health, housing, and education. Also in 1974, Humanist philosopher H. J. Blackham said humanism is a concept that focuses on improving the social conditions of humanity, increasing the autonomy and dignity of all humans. In 1999, Jeaneane D. Fowler said the definition of humanism should include a rejection of divinity, and an emphasis on human well-being and freedom. She also comments there is a lack of a shared belief system or doctrine but, in general, humanists are aiming for happiness and self-fulfillment.In 2015, prominent humanist Andrew Copson attempted to define humanism as follows:"," Soon, other scholars such as Georg Voigt and Jacob Burckhardt adopted the term.

This was the ‘paradox’ of the relationship between form and authority.127 The paradox was perhaps overstated: the authority of the Articles rests not just in the body that produced the text, but in the role of States both during their drafting and in their engagement with the Articles ever since. The hope is that the General Assembly’s current stalemate in respect of the final status of the Articles will not invert this paradox: that disagreements over form may begin to overshadow the substance of the Articles.","Whatever the case, however, it is crucial that States in the General Assembly make a decision on their final status.","David Caron had warned that the form of the Articles would overshadow disagreements over substance: that, entranced by their neat form, practitioners of international law would overlook some of the deep uncertainties that lingered in some parts of the Articles.",4,We might be focusing on the wrong things.,David Caron said that how the Articles were written was more important than the disagreements about them.

Heinrich Triepel and Dionisio Anzilotti are chief among them: the former setting out general notions of attribution, the latter identifying the law of responsibility as a distinct set of general and abstract rules, which did not distinguish between different types of violations. Anzilotti’s influence on Ago is clear from the latter’s 1939 course at The Hague Academy of International Law, ‘Le Délit International’, and was openly acknowledged. As Crawford had noted, this way of thinking about responsibility ‘in principle … reflected the situation as it had developed in international law’.","It has been said that, in the ILC’s work on the topic, ‘every aspect of responsibility has been more or less overturned’.","And, clearly, the Commission’s encoding exercise crystallised and forged new concepts and clarified others.",4,They have given us new ideas about food labels.,The Commission made old ideas clearer and explained new ones.,The Commission's exercise helped create new ideas and made existing ones clearer.,2,3,3

I have an awareness of death within me, Leiris maintains, therefore there must have been an event in which it was created. Such an event is necessarily located in childhood; it is a distinct and specific event, and it left resonances in the entire psychic system. Now it has to be found. Leiris is thus on a hunt for some kind of primary scene, one specific thing that has to be unveiled, a focal point, in what seems like a caricature of psychoanalysis.","Something, however, remains troublesome in the seemingly natural connection between the subject of death and the hypothesis of a lacuna in memory around the awareness of death, as well as in the passionate manner in which Leiris becomes involved in the task of unearthing it.

Wikipedia,Philosophy,"Many authors have written about excess deaths under Communist states and mortality rates, such as excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. Some authors posit that there is a Communist death toll, whose death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of the deaths that are included in them, ranging from lows of 10–20 million to highs over 100 million. The higher estimates have been criticized by several scholars as ideologically motivated and inflated; they are also criticized for being inaccurate due to incomplete data, inflated by counting any excess death, making an unwarranted link to communism, and the grouping and body-counting itself. Higher estimates account for actions that Communist governments committed against civilians, including executions, man-made famines, and deaths that occurred during, or resulted from, imprisonment, and forced deportations and labor. Higher estimates are criticized for being based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable, skewed to higher possible values, and victims of civil wars, the Holodomor and other famines, and war-related events should not be included. Others have argued that, while certain estimates may not be accurate, ""quibbling about numbers is unseemly. What matters is that many, many people were killed by communist regimes.""There is no consensus among genocide scholars and scholars of Communism about whether some or all the events constituted a genocide. There is also no consensus on a common terminology, and the events have been variously referred to as excess mortality or mass deaths; other terms used to define some of such killings include classicide, crimes against humanity, democide, genocide, politicide, holocaust, and repression. Scholars state that most Communist states did not engage in mass killings; some in particular, such as Benjamin Valentino, propose the category of Communist mass killing, alongside colonial, counter-guerrilla, and ethnic mass killing, as a subtype of dispossessive mass killing to distinguish it from coercive mass killing. While some scholars do not consider ideology or regime-type as an important factor that explains mass killings, others, such as John Gray, Daniel Goldhagen, and Richard Pipes consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings."," Some authors posit that there is a Communist death toll, whose death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of the deaths that are included in them, ranging from lows of 10–20 million to highs over 100 million.

He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called _de la vache enragé_; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one at night because one’s rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has to devour.

At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.","At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor.

Whether intentional or not, these critiques embrace a neoconservative perspective on public life where media are seen to have a corrosive role in political processes. In this view, more espoused by political scientists than communication scholars, journalistic values are at odds with political values, which results in a news agenda that misrepresents what is at stake. The news media thus distort political reality and fail their information role – a major proposition, along with media interventionism, that emerges from the broader crisis of political communication practice that has been incubating for some time.",,"In their extensive reviews of the political communication literature, Bucy and D’Angelo (1999, 2004) identify three sustained criticisms of the press in politics, formulated as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis.",5,Three things are wrong with the press and politics.

Wikipedia,Natural Sciences,"Within the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. Plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds. Eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles. In terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of tubulin (e.g., α-tubulin and β-tubulin whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins. Microfilaments are made up of actin molecules that interact with other strands of proteins."," Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively.
